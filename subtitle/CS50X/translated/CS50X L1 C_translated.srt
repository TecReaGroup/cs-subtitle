DAVID MALAN: All right, so this is CS50.
大卫·马兰：好的，这是 CS50。

3
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,310
And this is week 1, zero index, so to speak.
这是第一周，可以说，从零开始。

4
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,890
And it's not every day that you can say that you've learned a new language,
你并不每天都能说你学习了一门新的语言，

5
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,260
but today is that day.
但今天是那一天。

6
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,010
Today, we explore a more traditional and older language called C.
今天，我们将探索一种更传统、更古老的语言，叫做 C。

7
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:22,450
And rest assured that even if what you're about to see-- no pun intended--
请放心，即使你将要看到的内容——我并没有说双关语——

8
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,420
looks very cryptic, very unusual, particularly if you're
看起来非常神秘，非常不寻常，特别是如果你

9
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,967
among those less comfortable, cling to the ideas from last week,
是那些不太舒服的人，那就坚持上周的思路，

10
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:32,050
week zero, wherein we talked about some of those fundamentals of functions
第零周，我们讨论了一些函数的基础知识

11
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,230
and loops and conditionals, all of which are coming back today.
循环和条件语句，所有这些今天都会回来。

12
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,815
Indeed, whereas last week, and with problem set 0,
事实上，上周，以及在习题集 0 中，

13
00:01:37,815 --> 00:01:39,940
we focused on learning how to program with Scratch,
我们专注于学习如何用 Scratch 编程，

14
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:44,770
which, again, you might have played with as a younger student days back.
你可能在小时候玩过。

15
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,870
Today, we focus on C instead.
今天，我们将专注于 C 语言。

16
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,260
But along the way, we're going to focus, as always, frankly,
但在此过程中，我们始终如一地关注，坦率地说，

17
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,850
on learning how to solve problems.
学习如何解决问题。

18
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,820
But among the goals for today and really on an entire class like this
但今天的目标，以及这门课的目标，

19
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,610
is just to give you week after week all the more tools for your toolkit,
只是每周给你提供更多工具，

20
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,680
so to speak, via which to do exactly that.
可以用这些工具来完成这些。

21
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,860
So for instance today, we'll learn how to solve problems all the more
例如，今天，我们将学习如何用更多的方法来解决问题

22
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,420
so with functions, as per last week.
使用函数，就像上周一样。

23
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,910
We'll do the same with variables.
我们也会用变量做同样的事情。

24
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,789
We'll do the same with conditionals, with loops, and with more.
我们也会用条件语句、循环等等做同样的事情。

25
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,190
But we'll also learn at the end of today's class
但我们也会在今天课的最后学习

26
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,970
really how not to solve problems.
如何不能解决问题。

27
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,410
It turns out as powerful as Macs, PCs, cell phones are nowadays,
事实证明，尽管现在的 Mac、PC、手机功能强大，

28
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,890
there's actually certain things that they can't do very well
但实际上，它们有些事情做不好，

29
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,650
and information they can't represent very well.
它们无法很好地表示某些信息。

30
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,760
And that actually leads to a lot of real-world problems, both past
这实际上会导致很多现实世界中的问题，无论是过去

31
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,940
and surely future.
还是将来。

32
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,540
So more on what we're not going to be able to do with programming before
所以，在学习更多关于编程无法做到的事情之前，

33
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,040
long.
我们先来看看。

34
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,600
But beyond that, let's come back to this picture here.
除此之外，让我们回到这张图片。

35
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,900
So this was the very first program that I wrote,
这是我写的第一个程序，

36
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,880
that you wrote presumably in some form.
你可能也以某种形式写过。

37
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,400
And all it does is say "Hello, world."
它只做了一件事，就是说 "Hello, world"。

38
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,660
But as promised, today, this puzzle piece, or these puzzle pieces together,
但正如承诺的那样，今天，这块拼图，或者说这些拼图放在一起，

39
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,880
are going to very quickly start to look more like this.
会很快变得像这样。

40
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,295
And I've deliberately color coded it in a way so that the text on the screen
我特意用颜色编码了它，这样屏幕上的文本

41
00:02:54,295 --> 00:02:55,920
now kind of resembles the puzzle piece.
现在有点像拼图了。

42
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,540
So if I go back, notice that we had this, when green flag clicked puzzle
所以如果我回到这里，你会注意到，我们有这个，当绿旗被点击时，这块拼图

43
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,780
piece, mostly in yellow with the green flag, that sort of kicks off
这块拼图主要是黄色的，上面有绿色的旗帜，它开始

44
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,550
the whole process once you actually click
整个过程，一旦你点击

45
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,640
the button at top right of Scratch's user interface.
Scratch 用户界面右上角的按钮。

46
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,990
And then there's the purple block which actually is the verb, the action,
然后是紫色块，它实际上是动词，是动作，

47
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,620
the function that does something.
执行某个功能的函数。

48
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,820
So if I bring us back over to what we're about to see today,
所以让我们回到今天将要看到的内容，

49
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,477
there's going to be some boilerplate, so to speak, some orange text here
屏幕上会有一些模板，可以说是橙色的文字，

50
00:03:20,477 --> 00:03:23,060
on the screen that for now you just type and take for granted,
现在你只需要输入并视作理所当然，

51
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,430
like you need to write your code like that.
就像你必须那样写你的代码一样。

52
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,435
But more interesting is going to be the purple.
但更有趣的是紫色部分。

53
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:29,810
And we're going to see today that the function previously
我们今天将看到之前

54
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,430
called "say" in Scratch is now called "printf" in this language called C.
在 Scratch 中叫做 "say" 的函数，现在在这门叫做 C 的语言中叫做 "printf"。

55
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,520
But in white here, you'll see similar text to our white oval
但在这里的白色部分，你会看到类似于我们上周的白色椭圆的文字，

56
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,550
last week, whereby that's where user input, like your input
上周，那是用户输入，就像你作为程序员的输入

57
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,277
as the programmer, can actually go.
可以实际输入的地方。

58
00:03:42,277 --> 00:03:43,610
So there's a lot of distraction.
所以有很多干扰。

59
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,930
And honestly, it's these kinds of things that
说实话，正是这些东西

60
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,180
tend to distract and get frustrating early on when
在学习编程初期容易造成干扰，让人感到沮丧，

61
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,780
learning to code for the first time.
第一次学习编程的时候。

62
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,170
But the ideas, most importantly, are going to be the same.
但最重要的是，这些想法会是一样的。

63
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,060
So how are we going to go about using this.
那么我们如何使用它呢？

64
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,910
Well, it turns out, like last week, you're
事实证明，就像上周一样，你会

65
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,190
going to start writing something called source code.
开始编写一些叫做源代码的东西。

66
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,280
So code as we know it, quote, unquote, is more technically called
所以我们所知道的代码，引号内的“代码”，在技术上更准确地称为

67
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,060
"source code."
“源代码”。

68
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,460
That's what you and I as humans actually write.
那就是你我作为人类实际编写的东西。

69
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,350
And indeed it might look a little something like we just saw.
而且确实它看起来有点像我们刚刚看到的。

70
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,090
But unfortunately, computers only speak this, binary--
但不幸的是，计算机只能理解这种语言，二进制——

71
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,660
zeros and ones-- more properly known as machine code, in other words,
零和一——更准确地说，是机器代码，换句话说，

72
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,550
those same patterns of zeros and ones last week, someone guessed,
上周，有人猜到了那些相同的零和一的模式，

73
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,090
print out "hello, world" on the screen because one of those patterns
在屏幕上打印出 "hello, world" 因为其中一个模式

74
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:27,570
is an H. Another pattern is an E, an L, and L, and an O, and so forth.
是一个 H。另一个模式是 E、L、L、O 等等。

75
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,880
And then other patterns of those zeros and ones are commands or instructions
然后，那些零和一的其他模式就是命令或指令

76
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,280
to the computer that literally say, show H-E-L-L-O comma "world" on the screen.
对计算机来说，实际上就是说，在屏幕上显示 H-E-L-L-O 逗号 "world"。

77
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,520
But machine code would not be nearly as much fun
但机器代码如果真的用零和一写的话，就没有那么有趣了

78
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,070
to write if it were indeed in zeros and ones.
了。

79
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,080
Entirely for us, ideally, you and I are going
理想情况下，完全是为了我们，你我都会

80
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,100
to write source code, which conceptually is sort of up here, high level.
去编写源代码，从概念上讲，它就像是这里，高级别。

81
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,790
But we're going to need a program to convert it to the lower-level machine
但我们需要一个程序来将其转换为低级别的机器

82
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,240
code so that we don't spend our lives actually having to read and write
代码，这样我们就不用花一辈子的时间去读写

83
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,000
zeros and ones, which back in the day, kind of in yesteryear,
零和一，在过去，也就是前几年，

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,160
you kind of did with things called punch cards
你用的是叫做打孔卡的东西

85
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,050
and holes on physical sheets of paper.
以及纸质卡片上的孔。

86
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,440
We're beyond that because after years and years of innovation,
我们已经超越了那一步，因为经过多年的创新，

87
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,462
folks have given us higher-level languages instead.
人们给了我们更高等级的语言。

88
00:05:09,462 --> 00:05:11,420
So here's what we're going to need to do today.
所以今天我们需要做的事情是。

89
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,900
If at the end of the day you and I are writing source code
如果最终你我编写的是源代码

90
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,260
but we want machine code as output, we need something
但我们想要机器代码作为输出，我们需要一些东西

91
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,900
in the middle that's going to convert that source code to machine code.
在中间来将源代码转换为机器代码。
