47
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,590
And I didn't because when I got to campus, as a first-year,
我没修是因为当我作为大一新生来到校园时，

48
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,350
I really gravitated toward things already familiar, things
我真的倾向于那些我熟悉的东西，那些

49
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,450
with which I was already comfortable, specifically, government.

50
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,700
And I came in here thinking I was going to major or concentrate in government.
我来到这里，以为自己要主修或专注于政府。

51
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,840
And it was only once I got to sophomore year, fall semester,
直到我升入大二，秋季学期，

52
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,300
that some friends of mine were coming to this class called
我才发现一些朋友要来上这门课，叫

53
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,290
CS50 that was very much to beware at the time, in that it
CS50，那门课当时真的很让人望而生畏，因为它

54
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,870
was an unfamiliar field to so many of us, myself included.
对我们很多人来说都是一个陌生的领域，包括我自己。

55
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,320
But I got up the nerve to go over the threshold, sit in on the first class,
但我鼓起勇气跨过了门槛，参加了第一堂课，

56
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,280
just shop it, so to speak.
可以这么说，我只是试听一下。

57
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,570
And I was hooked.
然后我上瘾了。

58
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,470
I found that homework was, for the first time, fun.
我发现作业第一次变得有趣了。

59
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,783
And this was after having enrolled only because the professor let
而我之所以注册，只是因为教授允许

60
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:06,200
me enroll pass/fail or [INAUDIBLE] because I didn't really
我以 P/F 方式注册，或者[听不清]，因为我真的

61
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,283
think I could even cut it.
不认为自己能应付得了。

62
00:05:07,283 --> 00:05:10,020
But fast forward to five Mondays later in the semester,
但快进到学期中之后的五个星期一，

63
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,020
I actually switched to a letter grade, deciding,
我实际上改成了字母成绩，决定，

64
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,240
wow, this is actually something for me.
哇，这对我来说真的很不错。

65
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,480
And I say this because computer science, what
我说这些是因为计算机科学，我当时没有意识到的是，它真的

66
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,640
I didn't realize about it at the time, really
是一种非常通用的思考方式和解决问题的方式。

67
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,680
is this very general purpose way of thinking and way of solving problems.
即使这是你唯一修过的 CS 课程，

68
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,490
And even if this is the only CS class you ever take,
即使这是你唯一的编程正规培训，

69
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,940
even if this is the only formal training you have in programming
作为一项实用技能，它真的太适用

70
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,550
as a practical skill, it's just so darn applicable
于许多其他领域了——艺术、人文、社会科学、

71
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,670
to so many other fields-- the arts, humanities, social sciences,
自然科学等等，当然也包括 STEM 领域，

72
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:39,660
natural sciences, and beyond, and certainly within the STEM fields,
本身。

73
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,530
themselves.
也就是说，它经常会让人感觉有点像这样。

74
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,810
That said, it's going to often feel a little something like this.
这是我们麻省理工学院的朋友们的作品，就在附近，是他们的一次黑客活动

75
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,310
This is from our friends at MIT, down the road, which is one of their hacks
他们将一个消防栓连接到一个饮水喷泉上，

76
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,300
whereby they connected a fire hydrant to a drinking fountain,
上面还贴了一个小牌子，上面写着，“从麻省理工学院接受教育就像

77
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,960
with a little sign up there that says, "GETTING AN EDUCATION FROM MIT IS LIKE
喝消防水龙头的水，”也就是说，在很多时候，在这门课中，

78
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,480
DRINKING FROM A FIRE HOSE," which is to say that it's
你会经常觉得，

79
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,310
going to feel, quite often, in this class,
有很多信息。

80
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,260
too, that there's just a lot of information.
你不可能全部吸收，但要意识到

81
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,960
And you can't possibly absorb it all, but realize
这是意料之中的，尤其是在入门课上。

82
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,750
that's to be expected, especially in an introductory class.
重点是让很多东西感觉很新，但随着练习，随着时间的推移，

83
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:11,520
The whole point is for so much of it to feel new, but with practice, with time,
甚至几年后，回过头来看，你就会对这些材料越来越得心应手。

84
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,390
with years, even, looking back, will you get all the more
但你并不应该在学习过程中感到舒适。

85
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,640
comfortable with the material.
所以我鼓励你，邀请你，期望

86
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,340
But you're not meant to feel comfortable along the way.
你在学习过程中能适应这种不适，

87
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,340
And so let me encourage you, invite you, expect
无论你是否拥有计算机科学或编程方面的经验。

88
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,580
you to get comfortable feeling uncomfortable along the way,
现在，在我那个年代，课程大纲略有不同。

89
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,390
whether you have or have not prior computer science or programming
而且，实际上，当我和我的所有同学完成这门课后，

90
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,080
experience.
我们会告诉朋友，我们学会了用 C 语言编程，这门语言我们自己也会学习。

91
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,130
Now, back in my day, the class' syllabus was a little bit different.
但那是唯一一门语言。

92
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,438
And, really, when I and all of my classmates exited the class,
但现在，你会看到，我们不仅会学习这门叫做 C 的旧语言，还会学习一门叫做 Python 的更现代的语言，

93
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:37,230
we would say to friends that we learned how
这门语言在数据科学、Web 应用等领域非常流行，

94
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,860
to program in C, which is a language that we, ourselves, will still
以及更多领域。

95
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,860
learn in this class.
。

96
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,040
But that was it for languages.
。

97
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,950
But nowadays, as you'll see, we'll explore not just
。

98
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,560
this older language called C, but a more modern language
。

99
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,580
called Python that's very much in vogue for data science, and web applications,
。

100
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,460
and much more.
。

101
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,293
But we'll also introduce you, along the way,
但我们也会在学习过程中，

102
00:06:56,293 --> 00:07:01,020
to another language called S-Q-L or SQL, which is specifically for databases.
介绍另一种称为 S-Q-L 或 SQL 的语言，专门用于数据库。

103
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,330
And SQL is a different type of programming language
而 SQL 是一种不同类型的编程语言

104
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,060
that's just going to give you different ways of solving problems,
它只是提供了解决问题的不同方法，

105
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,480
different building blocks with which to express problems you want to solve.
不同的构建模块，用于表达你想要解决的问题。

106
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,670
We'll introduce you, toward the end of the semester,
在学期末，我们会向你介绍

107
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,040
yet another language, JavaScript, often used
另一种语言，JavaScript，通常与

108
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,415
with markup languages called HTML and CSS, with which maybe you
标记语言 HTML 和 CSS 配合使用，也许你

109
00:07:17,415 --> 00:07:19,290
have some experience if you've made websites.
如果做过网站，你可能会有一些经验。

110
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,640
But we'll do this because so many of today's actual real-world software
但我们会这样做，因为当今实际的现实世界软件

111
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,630
is web-based.
都是基于网络的。

112
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,450
Or it's phone-based, mobile-based, but even then,
或者它基于手机、基于移动设备，但即使那样，

113
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,000
it's using these same languages, like JavaScript.
它也使用这些相同的语言，比如 JavaScript。

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,700
And so by the end of CS50, in particular,
所以到 CS50 结束时，尤其是

115
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,820
you won't know how to program in X, or Y, or Z, per se.
你不会知道如何用 X、Y 或 Z 编程，严格来说。

116
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,150
But, period, you'll learn how to program.
但是，总之，你会学会编程。

117
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,190
And, indeed, among the goals of this class
实际上，这门课的目标之一

118
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:45,540
is to equip you with enough of a set of concepts, enough practical skills
是让你掌握足够的概念，足够的实用技能

119
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,440
and experience that after CS50, again, if you never take another CS class,
和经验，以便在 CS50 之后，再次强调，如果你不再学习任何其他 CS 课程，

120
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,690
you can teach yourself new languages.
你可以自学新的语言。

121
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,650
And you won't feel--

122
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,440
you won't have been reliant on a class to, indeed,
你不会依赖于某个课程来，实际上，

123
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,508
introduce you to each and one of those ideas.

124
00:07:57,508 --> 00:07:59,550
And what are we going to do, then, in this class?

Well, we're going to learn how to solve problems.
好吧，我们将学习如何解决问题。

127
00:08:03,402 --> 00:08:05,610
And that's really what computer science is all about.
而这正是计算机科学的精髓所在。

128
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,090
We'll, very specifically, today, knock off a few to-dos.
我们今天会非常具体地完成一些待办事项。

129
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,130
We'll learn how to represent simple things, like numbers.

and use most every day.
并且每天都在使用。

140
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,370
But we'll also focus today, ultimately, on how

00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,360
using certain ideas and techniques, all of which you'll exit the course with.
使用某些想法和技巧，当你离开这门课的时候，你都会掌握。

230
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,378
So, as such, problem solving is a goal that we'll

231
00:12:43,378 --> 00:12:45,920
approach by way of something called "computational thinking."

236
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,880
can apply to problems from this field or most any other, but in a computational,
可以应用到这个领域或几乎所有其他领域的问题，但以一种计算的方式，

237
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,770
that is, a very methodical, very careful way.
也就是说，一种非常有条理，非常谨慎的方式。

00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,790
Let me propose that this is it.
让我提议这就是它。

247
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:29,270
This is as simple as we can make today's goals and the semester's goals.

251
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,000
And then somewhere in the middle is the secret sauce,

252
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,375
where we'll spend the next several weeks figuring out how
我们将花接下来的几周时间弄清楚如何

253
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,350
we can convert these inputs to outputs.
将这些输入转换为输出。

254
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,870
But before we can do that, we all just have

00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,260
to agree on how to represent these inputs and outputs,

只说或知道 0 和 1，即所谓的二进制系统。

260
00:14:00,823 --> 00:14:02,990
But that's just one way of representing information.
但这只是表示信息的一种方式。

261
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,150
Even simpler than binary is unary.
比二进制更简单的则是 unary。

262
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:10,670
So if you've ever, at this age or any prior age, counted on your fingers,
所以，如果你曾经，在这个年龄或任何之前年龄，用手指计数，

271
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,610
But I'm going to go further and say the answer, if you're clever about it,
但我还要更进一步，说答案是，如果你很聪明，

272
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,500
is actually--
实际上是——

273
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,132
AUDIENCE: 40?
观众：40？

274
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:38,340
DAVID J. MALAN: Not quite 40.
大卫·马兰：不是 40。

275
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,660
You overbid, but--
你出价过高，但是——

276
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,500
AUDIENCE: 31.
观众：31。

277
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,885
DAVID J. MALAN: 31 is as high as I can actually count.
大卫·马兰：31 是我能数到的最高数字。

278
00:14:43,885 --> 00:14:46,260
And that's because if I actually-- and if you're thinking
这是因为，如果我实际上—— 如果你正在思考

279
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,530
this is weirdly painful now, it will be, but this
现在这有点奇怪地令人痛苦，它确实如此，但这

280
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,600
is my hand representing the number 0.
是我的手代表的数字 0。

281
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,980
Normally, in unary, this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, of course, obviously.
通常，在 unary 计数法中，这是 1、2、3、4、5，当然，很明显。

282
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,290
But what if I take into account the order in which I'm
但是，如果我考虑我

283
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,590
putting my fingers up and down?
上下伸手指的顺序呢？

284
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,840
So maybe this is still 0.
所以，也许这仍然是 0。

285
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,490
Maybe this is still 1.
也许这仍然是 1。

286
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:07,410
But maybe this is now 2, where it's just the single second finger up,
但也许现在这是 2，那里只有第二根手指伸起来，

287
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,940
not two of them, total.
总共不是两个。

288
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,860
Maybe this is now 3.
也许现在是3。

289
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,730
Maybe this is now-- often offensive, with just the middle finger up.
也许现在是——通常是冒犯的，只有中指竖起来。

290
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,250
This is now [LAUGHS] 5.
现在是[笑声] 5。

291
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,260
This is now 6.
现在是 6。

292
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,160
This is now 7.
现在是 7。

293
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,010
And my hand just hurts too much if I try to count higher than seven.
如果我尝试数到超过七，我的手就太痛了。

294
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,640
But, theoretically, because each of my fingers can be down or up
但从理论上讲，因为我的每根手指都可以是向下或向上

295
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:32,230
and I've got five of them, that's actually 32 possible permutations,
而我有五根手指，实际上有 32 种可能的排列组合，

296
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,890
up and down.
向上和向下。

297
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:33,640
But wait a minute.
等等。

298
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,130
We said, 31, but if you start at 0.
我们说是 31，但如果从 0 开始。

299
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,735
You have to subtract 1 from the biggest possible value.
您需要从最大的可能值中减去 1。

300
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:41,860
So this is to say you and I have been using unary because it's just simple,
所以也就是说，你和我都一直在使用一元制，因为它很简单，

301
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,100
and it gets the job done.
而且它能完成工作。

302
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,750
But if we just think about representation a little more cleverly,
但如果我们更巧妙地思考一下表示方式，

303
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,410
we can do exactly what computers do, using not what mathematicians call
我们可以做到与计算机完全相同的事情，而不是使用数学家所说的

304
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,460
"base-1," where the finger is either there or it's not, but base-2.
“1 进制”，手指要么存在要么不存在，而是 2 进制。

305
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,390
And in base-2, we just need two digits at our disposal.
在 2 进制中，我们只需要两个数字。

306
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,720
And we could call these digits 1 and 2, A and B, black or white.
我们可以称这些数字为 1 和 2，A 和 B，黑色或白色。

307
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,370
We just need two words to describe two pieces of information.
我们只需要两个词来描述两条信息。

308
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,600
Computers keep it simple.
计算机保持简单。

309
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,960
And just like we humans start counting 0, 1, 2, 3 on up,
就像我们人类开始从 0、1、2、3 开始计数一样，

310
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,230
computers use 0 and 1, and that's it.
计算机使用 0 和 1，仅此而已。

311
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,710
But that's by convention.
但这只是一个约定。

312
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,940
But why do they do that?
但为什么他们这样做？

313
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,930
Well, it turns out, when you use base-2, otherwise known as binary, well,
事实证明，当你使用 2 进制（也称为二进制）时，

314
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,030
it just maps really readily to the real world.
它很容易映射到现实世界。

315
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,947
Because, at the end of the day, what do we all
因为，归根结底，我们所有人

316
00:16:25,947 --> 00:16:28,740
do, if you've got a laptop, or a phone, or any device?
在你有笔记本电脑、手机或任何设备的情况下，会做什么？

317
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,310
You plug it into the wall because it needs electricity at some point.
你需要将它插到墙上，因为它在某个时刻需要电力。

318
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,820
And what if you have electricity or not?
如果你是有电力还是没有电力？

319
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,190
Well, there's your two possible values.
那么，这就是你两种可能的取值。

320
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,910
Either it's there, or it's not.
要么是存在，要么是不存在。

321
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,000
And because computers are electrical devices,
由于计算机是电子设备，

322
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,675
this is why binary is just useful.
这就是二进制如此有用的原因。

323
00:16:43,675 --> 00:16:44,550
It's nice and simple.
它简单而实用。

324
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,920
Either electricity is there, or it's not.
要么有电力，要么没有。

325
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,810
So when you plug this device in and you've
所以，当你将这个设备插入并拥有

326
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,060
got all these electrons or whatever flowing, maybe
所有的这些电子或其他东西流动，也许

327
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,250
if we just hang on to some of that electricity,
如果我们保留一些电力，

328
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,230
we can represent what we'll call a 1.
我们可以用 1 来表示。

329
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,470
And maybe if we let it dissipate or go away, that's a 0.
如果让它消散或消失，那就表示 0。

330
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:02,760
So on and off maps very readily to this idea of just 0's and 1's.
因此，开和关很容易映射到 0 和 1 的概念。

331
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,750
And if you've ever thought of this, now, as binary digits--
如果你曾经将此视为二进制数字——

332
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,380
"bi" implying 2, 0 and 1-- well, if you've ever heard this term now,
“bi” 表示 2，0 和 1 —— 如果你曾经听说过这个词，

333
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,690
"bit," it just means binary digit.
“比特”，它只表示二进制数字。

334
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,688
A single bit is just a 0 or 1.
一个比特只是一个 0 或 1。

335
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:16,980
But we could have called these things anything we want.
但我们可以随意称呼这些东西。

336
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,069
Now how does this map to be clear to the real world?
现在，这如何映射到现实世界中？

337
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:23,470
Well, we can't see the tiny little switches inside of our Macs,
嗯，我们无法看到 Mac 内部、

338
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:26,140
PCs, and our phones that are actually turning the electricity on
PC 和手机内部那些实际控制电力的开关，

339
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,480
or off, storing electricity or not.
打开或关闭，存储或不存储电力。

340
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,920
But they're called transistors.
但它们被称为晶体管。

341
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,470
They've got millions of them in today's hardware.
现代硬件中拥有数百万个晶体管。

342
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,317
And they're just on or off, like a switch or a light bulb.
它们只是开或关，就像开关或灯泡。

343
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:37,150
So, for instance, if there's no electricity,
例如，如果没有电力，

344
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:40,690
the switch is off, we would call this, by convention, a 0.
开关处于关闭状态，根据约定，我们将其称为 0。

345
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:45,160
If, though, you throw the switch and it actually turns on, we would call this--
但是，如果你按下开关，它实际上打开了，我们会将其称为——

346
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,940
AUDIENCE: On.
观众：开。

347
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,607
DAVID J. MALAN: --an "on," exactly, a 1.
戴维·J·马兰：——“开”，没错，1。

348
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:48,690
We could have reversed it.
我们也可以反过来。

349
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,160
But this is just the way the world decided to standardize.
但这只是世界决定标准化的方式。

350
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,910
And that's it.
就是这样。

351
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,780
So you've either got something on or off, a 1 or a 0.
所以，你只能是开或关，1 或 0。

352
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:00,020
And this, then, is this thing we know now as a binary digit or a bit.
因此，这就是我们现在所知的二进制数字或比特。

353
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:04,490
So once we've got these values, what about how--
那么，一旦我们有了这些值，如何——

354
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,090
how can we go about, perhaps, representing things?
如何才能表示事物呢？

355
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,060
Well, you know what?
你知道吗？

356
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,352
It turns out we've got a lot of light bulbs right here.
事实证明，我们这里有很多灯泡。

357
00:18:10,352 --> 00:18:11,260
Let me grab-- thanks.
让我拿一下——谢谢。

358
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,010
Excuse me, spot.
打扰一下，地方。

359
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:16,540
Let me grab the little music stand here.
让我拿一下这里的小乐谱架。

360
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,610
Let me borrow a couple of these bulbs and see
让我借几个灯泡看看

361
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:22,310
if we can't make clearer than my hand, alone, what's going on here.
是否可以比我的手更清晰地说明这里发生了什么。

362
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,970
So I'm going to go ahead and grab two of these.
所以我要去拿两个。

363
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,670
And I'll just put them here.
我就把它们放在这里。

364
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,420
And I can turn these things on or off now.
现在我可以打开或关闭这些东西了。

365
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,560
So if I've got two bits, two switches, two transistors, if you will, well,
所以，如果我有两个比特，两个开关，两个晶体管，如果你愿意的话，

366
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:38,660
if I go ahead and turn on this one, I'm representing what number in binary,
如果我打开这个，我在二进制中表示哪个数字，

367
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,160
perhaps?
也许？

368
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,880
AUDIENCE: 1.
观众：1。

369
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,200
DAVID J. MALAN: So just 1.
戴维·J·马兰：所以只是 1。

370
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,130
Now, if I'm using unary, I would turn this one on and be done with it.
现在，如果我使用一元制，我会打开这个，然后就完成了。

371
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,980
And that's 2, but not in binary.
那是 2，但不是在二进制中。

372
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,350
Binary, it's the permutations, which ones are on and off, that matters.
在二进制中，重要的是排列组合，哪些是开哪些是关。

373
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,790
So what, now, am I representing here, perhaps?
那么，我现在正在这里表示什么？

374
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,370
AUDIENCE: 2.
观众：2。

375
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,120
DAVID J. MALAN: 2.
戴维·J·马兰：2。

376
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,210
So this is when I put my single pointer finger up.
所以，当我抬起我的食指时，

377
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,430
But then when I did this, in my human hand,
但当我用我的手这样做时，

378
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,310
this was like representing the number 3.
这就像表示数字 3。

379
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,640
How do I represent the number 4.
我该如何表示数字 4。

380
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,000
Yeah, I need another light bulb, so I need more hardware, so to speak.
是的，我需要另一个灯泡，所以说，我需要更多硬件。

381
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So if I turn--
所以，如果我打开——

382
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,180
if I leave this one-- if I turn this one on, this one off, this one off,
如果我保留这个——如果我打开这个，关闭这个，关闭这个，

383
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,380
now I have the number 4.
现在我有了数字 4。

384
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,593
And someone tell me, saying the words "on"
有人告诉我，说“开”

385
00:19:24,593 --> 00:19:26,510
and "on" and "on," or "on," or "off," or "on,"
和“开”和“开”，或者“开”，或者“关”，或者“开”，

386
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,850
using combinations of "on," "off" and-- "on"
使用“开”，“关”和——“开”的组合

387
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,832
and "off," how do I represent 5, from your left to your right?
还有“关”，怎么用从左到右的方式来表示 5？

388
00:19:32,832 --> 00:19:33,665
How about over here?
这边呢？

389
00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:34,880
AUDIENCE: On, off, on.
观众：开，关，开。

390
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,620
DAVID J. MALAN: "On, off, on," I heard.
大卫·马兰：我听到的是“开，关，开”。

391
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,480
And that's exactly right.
完全正确。

392
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,085
And how do I represent, maybe, 6?
那 6 怎么表示呢？

393
00:19:41,085 --> 00:19:41,585
Over here?
这边？

394
00:19:41,585 --> 00:19:43,010
AUDIENCE: Off, on, on.
观众：关，开，开。

395
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,080
DAVID J. MALAN: Off, on, on, not quite.
大卫·马兰：关，开，开，不太对。

396
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,995
From left to right?
从左到右？

397
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:47,390
AUDIENCE: Off-- the other way.
观众：关，另外一边。

398
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:47,620
DAVID J. MALAN: The--
大卫·马兰：那…

399
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,290
[LAUGHS] OK, so from right to left.
[笑] 好，从右到左。

400
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,960
So I think we leave this one on.
所以我觉得这个应该开着。

401
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:58,760
This one, I'm going to claim, represents, now, 6 and 7.
我声称，这个现在代表的是 6 和 7。

402
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,570
AUDIENCE: On, off.
观众：开，关。

403
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,300
DAVID J. MALAN: I'm just going to-- it's actually going to be "on, on, on."
大卫·马兰：我打算…实际上应该是“开，开，开”。

404
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,737
Now, if you're wondering, where are these people coming up
如果你想知道，这些人是怎么想出这些组合的，这里面其实是有规律的。

405
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:07,070
with these combinations, there's actually a system here.
如果你想知道，这些人是怎么想出这些组合的，这里面其实是有规律的。

406
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,770
It's actually hard for me to do it backwards.
我反着做实际上很难。

407
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:14,202
But it turns out there's actually a system that's not all that unfamiliar.
但事实证明，这套系统其实并不陌生。

408
00:20:14,202 --> 00:20:15,410
In fact, let me propose this.
实际上，我想提议…

409
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:18,770
Let me propose that we consider what you and I all
我想提议我们考虑一下，你和我都…

410
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:23,100
learned in grade school, which was something like the base-10 system, 10
在小学学到的，比如十进制系统，就是用十个数字，而不是两个，而是十个。

411
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,770
meaning that you use 10 different digits, not two, 10.
就是用十个数字，而不是两个，而是十个。

412
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:30,300
So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, that's the base-10 system, otherwise known
所以 0，1，2，3，4，5，6，7，8，9，这就是十进制系统，也叫…

413
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,370
as decimal, "dec" implying 10.
十进制，"dec" 表示十。

414
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,140
So that's what you and I use every day.
所以这就是我们每天使用的。

415
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,140
Well, let's think about how we represent numbers in decimal,
那么，我们想想如何在十进制中表示数字，

416
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,430
in the normal human way.
以正常的人类方式。

417
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,520
Well, here is a number.
这是一个数字。

418
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,380
It's what number, of course?
当然，是什么数字呢？

419
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,180
AUDIENCE: 123.
观众：123。

420
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,542
DAVID J. MALAN: 123.
大卫·马兰：123。

421
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,750
So we all just have an intuition for that, obviously.
所以我们对这个数字都有直觉，很明显。

422
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,420
But it's not necessarily 123.
但这并不一定是 123。

423
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,640
You're just assigning meaning to the positions of these digits.
你只是给这些数字的位置赋予了意义。

424
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,030
This is really the pattern 1-2-3.
实际上是 1-2-3 这个模式。

425
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,390
But you immediately jump, mathematically, to 123, but why?
但你立刻就从数学上跳到了 123，为什么呢？

426
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,390
Well, odds are, in grade school, you learned that the rightmost digit is
嗯，很有可能，你在小学学过，最右边的数字是…

427
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,160
the ones place or the ones column.
个位数或个位数列。

428
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,800
This is the tens place or the tens column.
这是十位数或十位数列。

429
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,490
This is the hundreds place.
这是百位数。

430
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,230
And so why is this relevant?
那么，这有什么意义呢？

431
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,190
Well, this is like doing 100 times 1 plus 10 times
嗯，这就像 100 乘以 1 加 10 乘以…

432
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:16,410
2 plus 1 times 3 or, if we multiply that out, 100 plus 20 plus 3,
2 加 1 乘以 3，或者，如果我们把它乘出来，就是 100 加 20 加 3，

433
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:21,240
ergo, the number, now, that we just take for granted is 123.
因此，这个数字，现在我们理所当然地认为是 123。

434
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,240
But that's in base-10, the so-called decimal system,
但那是十进制，也就是我们所说的十进制系统，

435
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,930
whereby each of these digits is in a different column.
每个数字都在不同的列里。

436
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:31,080
And those columns are, again, ones place, tens, hundreds.
这些列，还是个位数、十位数、百位数。

437
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,790
If we keep going, thousand, ten thousand, and so forth.
如果我们继续下去，千位数，万位数，等等。

438
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,040
But where did these come from?
但是这些是怎么来的呢？

439
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,957
Well, here's the base.
嗯，这就是底数。

440
00:21:35,957 --> 00:21:37,770
If you remember exponents and all of that,
如果你还记得指数和所有这些，

441
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:41,910
this is just 10 to the 0, 10 to the 1, 10 to the 2, ad infinitum.
这仅仅是 10 的 0 次方，10 的 1 次方，10 的 2 次方，无限循环下去。

442
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:46,860
And so, now, what if we just changed the base from 10, 0 through 9,
所以，现在，如果我们把底数从 10，也就是 0 到 9，

443
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,480
to just two digits, 0 and 1?
改为只有两个数字，0 和 1 呢？

444
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,610
Well, now the math is fundamentally the same.
嗯，现在数学原理是相同的。

445
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,880
But it's 2 to the 0, 2 to the 1, 2 to the 2,
但它是 2 的 0 次方，2 的 1 次方，2 的 2 次方，

446
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,030
which gives us the ones place, twos place, and fours place.
这就得到了个位数、两位数和四位数。

447
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,410
Now, why is this relevant?
现在，这有什么意义呢？

448
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:02,790
If you've got three light bulbs or three bits that are off, off, off,
如果你有三个灯泡或三个位，它们都是关着，关着，关着，

449
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,930
what have I done?
我做了什么？

450
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:07,710
4 times 0 plus 2 times 0 plus 1 times 0 is, obviously, the number
4 乘以 0 加 2 乘以 0 加 1 乘以 0，很明显，这个数字是…

451
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,990
you and I know, in decimal, as 0.
我们都知道，在十进制中是 0。

452
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,630
This, though, represents the number you and I know as--
但是，这代表的是我们所知的…

453
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,230
AUDIENCE: 1
观众：1

454
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,605
DAVID J. MALAN: This represents--
大卫·马兰：这个代表的是…

455
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:15,195
AUDIENCE: 2.
观众：2。

456
00:22:15,195 --> 00:22:17,910
DAVID J. MALAN: --3, 4.
大卫·马兰：…3，4。

457
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:21,540
And just to be clear, this is why, when I grabbed the additional light bulb,
为了说清楚，这就是为什么，当我拿了额外的灯泡时，

458
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,170
we claimed that this now was 4.
我们说这个现在是 4 了。

459
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:29,430
Because we had "on, off, off," "on, off, off."
因为我们有“开，关，关”，“开，关，关”。

460
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,960
This now is 5.
这个现在是 5。

461
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,190
This now is 6.
这个现在是 6。

462
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,240
This now is 7.
这个现在是 7。

463
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,480
And if I wanted to count higher, what would the pattern of 0's and 1's be
如果我想数更大的数字，0 和 1 的模式是什么呢？

464
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,478
for the number 8?
对于数字 8？

465
00:22:37,478 --> 00:22:38,942
AUDIENCE: 1, 0--
观众：1，0…

466
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,410
DAVID J. MALAN: 1, 0, 0, 0.
大卫·马兰：1，0，0，0。

467
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,330
So we just need more hardware, more bits.
所以我们只需要更多的硬件，更多的位。

468
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:45,630
So it wasn't arbitrary, even if it was non-obvious,
所以它并不是随意的，即使它并不明显，

469
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,660
what I was actually doing with turning these light bulbs on and off.
我实际上用这些灯泡的开和关在做什么。

470
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,730
Now, it turns out here we are talking about how to represent information,
现在，我们谈论的是如何表示信息，

471
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:59,490
like numbers, but we could also use bits, 0's and 1's, light bulbs
比如数字，但我们也可以用位，0 和 1，灯泡，

472
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,590
to represent instructions, as well.
来表示指令。

473
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,050
Because, at the end of the day, that's all computers do.
因为，归根结底，这就是电脑做的所有事情。

474
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,950
They process data, information of some sort, whether it's files,
它们处理数据，某种形式的信息，无论是文件，

475
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,290
or numbers, or images, or videos, or the like.
还是数字、图片、视频或类似的东西。

476
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:13,290
And you do things with those files.
你用这些文件做事情。

477
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:13,985
You open them.
你打开它们。

478
00:23:13,985 --> 00:23:14,610
You print them.
你打印它们。

479
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:15,610
You edit them and the like.
你编辑它们等等。

480
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,720
So there's this notion of instructions, what the computer can actually do.
所以，就有指令的概念，电脑实际上能做什么。

481
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,470
And I bet we could come up with some pattern of 0's and 1's
我敢打赌，我们可以想出一些 0 和 1 的模式，

482
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:26,970
or, equivalently, light bulbs that tell even Spot what to do.
或者，等价地，告诉 Spot 该做什么的灯泡。

483
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:30,785
Maybe, go up, or down, or left, or right.
也许，向上、向下、向左或向右。

484
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:33,660
And it could certainly do this autonomously by using various sensors.
它可以通过使用各种传感器自主地完成这些操作。

485
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,077
We need to keep things safe today.
我们今天需要确保安全。

486
00:23:35,077 --> 00:23:38,248
We're using Wi-Fi in sending Spot these very instructions.
我们正在使用 Wi-Fi 向 Spot 发送这些指令。

487
00:23:38,248 --> 00:23:41,040
But what's happening, wirelessly, with our friend Andrew, here, is,
但无线情况下，发生在我们朋友安德鲁身上的是

488
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,330
essentially, he's sending Spot instructions just encoded, wirelessly,
本质上，他只是将编码指令无线发送给Spot，

489
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,610
somehow, as patterns of 0's and 1's.
以某种方式，将其编码为 0 和 1 的模式。

490
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:51,390
And the folks at Boston Dynamics, who built this robot, programmed
而波士顿动力公司的人员，他们制造了这款机器人，他们对

491
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,330
Spot to recognize certain patterns as meaning "up,"
Spot进行了编程，使其能够识别某些模式，将其理解为“向上”，

492
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:57,030
a certain pattern as meaning "down," "left," "right,"
某些模式则代表“向下”、“向左”、“向右”，

493
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,505
and any number of other things.
以及其他许多事情。

494
00:23:58,505 --> 00:24:00,630
So, in fact, Spot, come on over here, if you could.
所以实际上，Spot，如果你可以的话，过来这里。

495
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,830
Come on, Spot.
来吧，Spot。

496
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,510

[脚步声]

497
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,640
OK.
好的。

498
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,400
So Spot, for instance, may very well have a pattern
所以Spot，例如，可能会有一个 0 和 1 的模式

499
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,190
of 0's and 1's that represents shake.
代表摇晃。

500
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,720
Shake, Spot.
摇晃，Spot。

501
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,330
So he could do that and any number of other movements, as well.
所以它可以做到这一点，以及其他许多动作。

502
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,680
And maybe, especially with sensors here and also a little human help over here,
也许，尤其是这里有传感器，还有这边有一点人类的帮助，

503
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,540
for today, what if we went ahead and did something-- maybe
今天，我们如果做点什么——也许

504
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,870
ask Spot some questions?
问Spot一些问题？

505
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,660
So let's go ahead, and we'll start simple.
所以，让我们继续，从简单的问题开始。

506
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:31,150
Spot, here we have some bits, "off, off, on."
Spot，这里我们有一些位，"关，关，开"。

507
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:34,030
Spot, what [LAUGHS]-- OK.
Spot，这是什么 [笑]——好的。

508
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:41,260
Spot, what is this representing, "off, off, on"?
Spot，这是什么意思，"关，关，开"？

非常像马，好的。

513
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,400
Thank you.
谢谢。

514
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
All right, so a round of applause for Spot here.
好的，所以让我们为Spot鼓掌。

So, Spot, what if we [LAUGHS] turn--
所以，Spot，如果我们 [笑] 把——

518
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:54,900
OK.
好的。

519
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,160
We'll turn that one off here.
我们将把这个关掉。

520
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,535
How about if we turn this one on?
如果我们把这个打开怎么样？

521
00:24:57,535 --> 00:24:59,280
So it's "off, on, off."
所以是 "关，开，关"。

529
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,440
How about, Spot, instead of "off, on, off,"
Spot，怎么样，不弄 "关，开，关"，

530
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,280
let's go ahead and do "off, on, on"?
我们来做 "关，开，开"？

[APPLAUSE]
[掌声]

538
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,450
So this is to say, no matter how--
所以我想说，无论多么——

539
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,140
thank you, Spot.
谢谢，Spot。

540
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,620
No matter how fancy today's hardware or software is,
无论今天的硬件或软件多么花哨，

541
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,720
it really just boils down to representing
它最终还是要归结为表示

542
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,838
information and instructions.
信息和指令。

543
00:25:44,838 --> 00:25:47,130
And computers, and phones, and the like really are just
而计算机、手机之类的东西实际上就是

544
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:51,460
operating on those same pieces of information,
处理这些相同的信息，

545
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,240
whether implemented in 0's and 1's or with, really, anything else.
无论是以 0 和 1 的形式实现，还是用其他任何东西。

546
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,740
All right.
好的。

547
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,880
So, where can we take this, once we have this agreed-upon system
那么，有了这个约定俗成的系统，我们能把它带到哪里去

548
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,030
for representing [LAUGHS] information?
来表示 [笑] 信息呢？

549
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:06,960
Well, it turns out that using three bits, three 0's and 1's, at a time,
事实证明，一次使用三位，三个 0 和 1，

550
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,700
isn't actually all that useful.
实际上并不是那么有用。

551
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,240
And you and I, even in conversation, don't often say the word "bit."
而你和我，即使在交谈中，也不常说 "位" 这个词。

552
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,500
We say the word "byte."
我们说 "字节" 这个词。

553
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,280
And what is a byte, if familiar?
如果熟悉的话，什么是字节？

554
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:15,780
Yeah?
是吗？

555
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,750
AUDIENCE: It's eight bits.
观众：它是八位。

556
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,417
DAVID J. MALAN: So it's just eight bits.
大卫·J·马兰：所以它就是八位。

557
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:20,200
It's just a more useful unit of measure.
它只是一个更实用的度量单位。

558
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,715
And it happens to be a power of 2, 2 to the third,
它恰好是 2 的幂，2 的三次方，

559
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:24,340
which just makes math work out cleanly.
这使得数学运算很干净利落。

560
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:27,610
But it's just a convention, to have more interesting units of measure
但这只是一个约定，为了拥有比单个位更有趣的度量单位

561
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,540
than individual bits.
而不是单个位。

562
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,350
So a byte is eight bits.
所以一个字节是八位。

563
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:34,690
So, for instance, this represents, using eight bits, eight light bulbs,
例如，这个用八位，八个灯泡，

564
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,460
the number you and I know is 0.
表示你我所知的数字 0。

565
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,960
And this byte of all 1 bits--
而这个全是 1 位的字节——

566
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,040
now you've got to do some quick math-- represents what number, instead?
现在你要做一些快速的数学运算——它代表什么数字？

567
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,657
So it's all 1's; eight of them, total.
所以全是 1，一共八个。

568
00:26:48,657 --> 00:26:49,990
How about over here, on the end?
这边呢？

569
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,050
AUDIENCE: 255.
观众：255。

570
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,992
DAVID J. MALAN: So it's, indeed, 255.
大卫·J·马兰：所以确实，是 255。

571
00:26:52,992 --> 00:26:54,700
Now, that's not the kind of math that you
现在，这不是你在

572
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,310
need to do in your head for a class like this, but you could.
这种课程中需要在脑子里进行的数学运算，但你可以这样做。

573
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:04,690
This is the ones place, twos, fours, eight, 16, 32, 64, 128.
这是个位、两位、四位、八位、十六位、三十二位、六十四位、一百二十八位。

574
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,800
And because they're all 1, you just have to add up all of those columns' values.
因为它们都是 1，你只需要将所有这些列的值加起来。

575
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,570
And you get 255.
然后你得到 255。

576
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,690
But a little mental trick, too, is that, if you've got eight bits
但还有一个心理技巧，就是如果你有八位

577
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:17,270
and each of them can be two possible values, 0 or 1,
而且每个位都有两种可能的值，0 或 1，

578
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:21,740
that's like 2 possibilities here times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2, eight times.
那就相当于 2 种可能乘以 2 乘以 2 乘以 2 乘以 2，一共八次。

579
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,310
So that's 2 to the eighth, so that is maybe a little easier to do.
所以那是 2 的 8 次方，可能更容易计算。

580
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,720
That's 256.
那就是 256。

581
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,780
Or easier, in the sense that you get used to seeing these numbers in CS.
或者说更容易，因为你在 CS 中经常看到这些数字。

582
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,220
That's 256.
那就是 256。

583
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,030
But wait a minute.
等等。

584
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:35,300
How do I reconcile this with your 255?
我该如何将它与你的 255 联系起来？

585
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,650
Because you start at 0.
因为你从 0 开始。

586
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:41,120
So you lose one on the high end because we started counting and representing
所以你在高位损失了一个，因为我们从计数和表示开始

587
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,830
the number, like 0.
数字，例如0。

588
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,760
All right.
好的。

589
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,570
Questions on how we've represented just numbers or, for instance,
关于我们如何表示数字，或者例如，

590
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:51,600
instructions to Spot, thus far?
到目前为止，对 Spot 的指令？

591
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,410
Any questions on binary, unary, or the like?
关于二进制、一元或类似的东西，还有其他问题吗？

592
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,010
No?
没有？

593
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,137
All right, so seeing none, let's let things escalate a bit.
好的，既然没有人提问，我们来升级一下难度。

594
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,470
So how do you represent letters because, obviously, this
那么，你如何表示字母，因为很明显，这个

595
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,262
makes our devices more useful, whether it's
使我们的设备更有用，无论是

596
00:28:05,262 --> 00:28:07,020
in English or any other human language.
英语还是其他任何人类语言。

597
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,740
How could we go about representing the letter A, for instance?
例如，我们如何表示字母 A 呢？

598
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,370
If, at the end of the day, all our computers,
如果说到底，我们所有的电脑，

599
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:17,390
all our phones have access to is electricity; or, equivalently,
我们所有的手机所能接触到的只有电；或者等效地，

600
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:20,570
switches; or, metaphorically, tiny little light bulbs
开关；或者比喻地说，就是里面可以开或关的小灯泡

601
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:23,750
inside of them that can be on and off-- that's it.
——就是这些。

602
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,990
There's no more building blocks to give you.
没有更多的构建块给你了。

603
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:30,530
How could we represent something like the letter A?
我们如何表示像字母 A 这样的东西？

604
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,000
Yeah, how about here?
是啊，这里怎么样？

605
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,812
Yeah?
是吧？

606
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:34,312
AUDIENCE: You could assign a number.
观众：你可以分配一个数字。

607
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:35,343
DAVID J. MALAN: Perfect.
大卫·J·马兰：完美。

608
00:28:35,343 --> 00:28:37,260
So we could just assign every letter a number.
所以我们可以简单地给每个字母分配一个数字。

609
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,677
And we could do this super simply.
我们可以非常简单地做到这一点。

610
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:42,660
Maybe 0 is A, and 1 is B. Or maybe 1 is A,
也许 0 是 A，1 是 B。或者也许 1 是 A，

611
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,110
and 2 is B. It doesn't really matter, so long as we all agree and we all
2 是 B。这并不重要，只要我们都同意，我们都

612
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,660
use the same types of computers, in some sense, ultimately.
使用相同类型的计算机，在某种意义上，最终来说。

613
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,730
Well, for various reasons, the humans that designed this system,
好吧，由于各种原因，设计这个系统的人类，

614
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,160
they went with the number 65.
他们选择了数字 65。

615
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,540
So, nowadays, anytime your computer is showing you the capital letter
因此，现在，每当你的电脑在屏幕上显示大写字母

616
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,690
A on the screen, underneath the hood, so to speak,
A 时，在幕后，可以说，

617
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:06,780
it's actually storing a pattern of 0's and 1's that represents the number 65.
它实际上存储着一串 0 和 1 的模式，代表着数字 65。

618
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,930
And it tends to use seven bits or, typically, eight bits, total,
它通常使用七位，或者通常是八位，总共，

619
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,790
even if it doesn't need all of those bits in total.
即使它并不需要所有这些位。

620
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,980
So how do we get there?
那么我们如何做到这一点呢？

621
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,490
Well, here, for instance, is that same pattern.
好吧，这里，例如，就是同一个模式。

622
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,980
Here is that pattern of bits that represents 65.
这里就是代表数字 65 的比特模式。

623
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,520
And why?
为什么？

624
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,200
Well, quick check here.
好吧，快速检查一下。

625
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:29,160
This is the ones place, twos, fours, eights, 16, 32, 64's place.
这是个位、两位、四位、八位、十六位、三十二位、六十四位。

626
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,640
OK, so 64 plus 1 gives me 65.
好的，所以 64 加 1 等于 65。

627
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,830
So that is to say here's how a computer, using some light switches, so to speak,
也就是说，这就是计算机用一些开关，比喻地说，

628
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,620
would represent the number 65.
来表示数字 65 的方式。

629
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,540
And our Macs, our PCs, our phones just all know this.
我们的 Mac、PC 和手机都知道这一点。

630
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,410
So whenever they see that in their memory, so to speak,
所以，每当它们在内存中看到它时，比喻地说，

631
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,560
they show a capital letter A on the screen.
它们就会在屏幕上显示一个大写字母 A。

632
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,520
So that's it.
就是这样。

633
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,250
That's the system known as ASCII, the American Standard
这就是被称为 ASCII 的系统，美国标准

634
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,840
Code for Information Interchange.
信息交换代码。

635
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,340
And the A is actually operative there because we're only talking, thus far,
而且 A 实际上在那里起作用，因为到目前为止，我们只讨论

636
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,500
about English letters in our alphabet.
英语字母表中的字母。

637
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,530
And, in fact, I claimed, a moment ago, that we only use
而且，事实上，我之前说过，我们只使用

638
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:06,250
seven, maybe eight bits to represent letters of an alphabet.
七位，也许是八位来表示字母表中的字母。

639
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,410
So, just to come back to you, if I may, how many
所以，如果可以，回到你那里，我们可以用八位表示多少个

640
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,900
possible letters of the alphabet could-- how
字母表中的字母？

641
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,350
many possible letters of any alphabet could we represent with eight bits?
我们可以用八位表示多少个字母表中的字母？

642
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,310
AUDIENCE: 256.
观众：256。

643
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:18,400
DAVID J. MALAN: 256, the numbers 0 through 255.
大卫·J·马兰：256，从 0 到 255 的数字。

644
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,650
Now, that's more than enough for English because we've
现在，这已经足够表示英语了，因为我们有

645
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,498
got A through Z, uppercase, lowercase, a bunch of numbers,
从 A 到 Z，大写、小写，一堆数字，

646
00:30:23,498 --> 00:30:24,790
a bunch of punctuation symbols.
一堆标点符号。

647
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:28,660
But in a lot of languages, with accented characters, a lot of Asian characters,
但是对于很多语言来说，有重音符号，很多亚洲字符，

648
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,230
this is not nearly enough memory or bits with which
这些内存或位根本不够

649
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,717
to represent all of those possible values.
来表示所有这些可能的值。

650
00:30:34,717 --> 00:30:36,550
So we need to do a little better than ASCII,
所以我们需要比 ASCII 更好一点，

651
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,200
but we can build on top of what they did years ago.
但我们可以建立在他们多年前所做之上的。

652
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,080
So here is a chart of ASCII codes.
这里是一个 ASCII 码表。

653
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,270
It's just a bunch of columns showing us the mapping between letters
它只是一堆列，向我们展示了字母之间的映射关系

654
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:44,770
and numbers.
和数字。

655
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:49,420
So, for instance, up here is the capital letter A, 65; capital B, 66;
例如，这里是大写字母 A，65；大写字母 B，66；

656
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,060
capital C, 67; dot, dot, dot.
大写字母 C，67；等等。

657
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:56,333
72 is H. 73 is I and so forth.
72 是 H。73 是 I，等等。

658
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:58,750
There's some weird things over here, like special symbols,
这里有一些奇怪的东西，比如特殊符号，

659
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,125
that we'll learn about over time.
我们会随着时间的推移了解这些。

660
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,230
But there's a mapping between every English letter
但是，每个英语字母

661
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,810
of the alphabet and some number, just as you'd propose,
与某个数字之间都有映射，就像你提出的那样，

662
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,710
both for uppercase and lowercase.
对于大写和小写都是如此。

663
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:10,580
So, for instance, if we highlight just a few of these for now
例如，如果我们现在只突出显示其中几个

664
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,998
and I say that I've just received a text message or an email that,
我收到一条短信或一封电子邮件，在幕后，

665
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,290
underneath the hood, so to speak, if I have the ability
说，如果我有能力

666
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:22,930
to look at what switches are on and off, I received this message here.
查看哪些开关是开着的，哪些是关着的，我收到了这里的信息。

667
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:26,020
Well, first-- and this is not what CS is about, but just fun fact.
好吧，首先——这并不是 CS 的重点，只是一个有趣的事实。

668
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:29,470
Does anyone know what number this would represent in decimal,
有人知道这个二进制模式在十进制中表示什么数字吗，

669
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:34,565
if this is the binary pattern, like ones place, twos place?
就像个位、两位一样？

670
00:31:34,565 --> 00:31:35,420
AUDIENCE: 72?
观众：72？

671
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,080
DAVID J. MALAN: 72 is correct.
大卫·J·马兰：72 是正确的。

672
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,600
And again, not, intellectually, all that interesting
再说一次，从智力上来说，这并不是那么有趣

673
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,780
and this is not the kind of math that we spend all day as CS--
这并不是我们作为计算机科学家整天做的那种数学——

674
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,905
a computer scientist doing.
一名计算机科学家所做的事情。

675
00:31:42,905 --> 00:31:45,380
But it's just following the same darn pattern, which
但是它只是遵循着相同的模式，

676
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,780
is to say it might look cryptic, but, conceptually,
也就是说，它可能看起来很神秘，但从概念上来说，

677
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,542
intellectually, it ultimately is exactly as we did before.
从智力上来说，它最终和我们之前做的一模一样。

678
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:52,250
So, yes, I'll spoil the rest of the math.
所以，是的，我会把剩下的数学问题都告诉你。

679
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,860
It's 72, 73, 33.
是 72、73、33。

680
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:58,370
Now, anyone remember, in your mind's eye, what message we just spelled?
现在，有人记得我们刚才拼写的字母吗？

681
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,180
AUDIENCE: Hi.
观众：嗨。

682
00:31:59,180 --> 00:31:59,810
AUDIENCE: Hi.

683
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,520
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, so it is, in fact, "Hi!"
大卫·J·马兰：是的，实际上是“嗨！”

684
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,270
Though, no one really said that excitedly.
不过，没有人真正兴奋地说。

685
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,580
What's the 33, if you noticed?
如果你注意到了，33 是什么？

686
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,600
AUDIENCE: Exclamation point.
观众：感叹号。

687
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,770
DAVID J. MALAN: OK, so a lot of people noticed.
大卫·J·马兰：好的，所以很多人注意到了。

688
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,630
Yes, it's an exclamation point.
是的，这是一个感叹号。

689
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:11,300
And that's, indeed, noticeable right here.
而且，确实，这里很明显。

690
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,063
33 is the exclamation point.
33 是感叹号。

691
00:32:13,063 --> 00:32:15,480
And that's just something, eventually, that might sink in.
而这只是，最终，可能让你恍然大悟的事情。

692
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,350
But, for the most part, if you remember capital A is 65,
但，大部分情况下，如果你记得大写字母 A 是 65，

693
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:22,100
you can figure out at least 25 other answers to these kinds of questions
你可以找出至少 25 个其他类似问题的答案

694
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,060
because they're all contiguous like that.
因为它们都是这样连续的。

695
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,740
So there's the exclamation point.
所以，这就是感叹号。

696
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:30,350
But at the end of the day, we might just have this mapping known as ASCII.
但最终，我们可能只会拥有这个被称为 ASCII 的映射。

697
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:33,000
And it's how our phones, and computers, and devices, more
而这就是我们的手机、电脑和设备，更多

00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,310
generally, actually store information.
一般来说，存储信息的实际方式。

699

00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,970
maybe take a little pressure off of me here.
也许可以减轻一下我的压力。

701
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:41,550
And could we maybe flip things around?
我们可以换个方式吗？

702
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:44,160
How about we try applying this newfound knowledge--
我们可以尝试应用这种新知识吗--

703
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,430
if it's, indeed, new to you-- with seven volunteers, seven bits, if we could?
如果你真的是第一次接触，我们可以用七位志愿者，七位，好吗？

00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,081
Yeah, I think you're one.
是的，我认为你是1。

812

[LAUGHTER]
[笑声]

813
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:20,980
OK.
好的。

814
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,430
Now what number are we spelling?
现在我们拼什么数字？

Thank you, Spot.
谢谢，斑点。

821
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,460
One final flourish.
最后一次华丽的收尾。

822
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,250
So we've spelled B-O--
所以我们已经拼出了B-O——

823
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,855
third letter, go ahead.
第三个字母，继续。

824
00:36:37,942 --> 00:36:40,230
[SPOT LANDS ON THE STAGE]
[斑点落在舞台上]

825
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,885
What number, now, is this?
现在，这个是什么数字？

826
00:36:42,885 --> 00:36:43,815
AUDIENCE: 87.
观众：87。

DAVID J. MALAN: I heard it here, 80--
戴维·J·马兰：我在这里听到是80——

829
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,320
AUDIENCE: Seven.
观众：七。

830
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:46,875
DAVID J. MALAN: --seven, which is?
戴维·J·马兰：——七，也就是？

831
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:47,505
AUDIENCE: W.
观众：W。

832
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,620
DAVID J. MALAN: W, which, of course, spells "bow."
戴维·J·马兰：W，当然，拼写成“bow”。

833
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:53,437
So if our volunteers could take a bow, Spot included.
所以，如果我们的志愿者可以鞠躬，包括斑点。

834
00:36:53,437 --> 00:36:56,636
[APPLAUSE]
[掌声]

835
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,540
So this will make more sense in week one,
所以这将在第一周更有意义，

836
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,750
when we have an assignment involving a certain someone from the Nintendo
当我们有一个作业涉及到任天堂世界中的某个人时

837
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:04,900
World.
世界。

838
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,760
But we have a lovely parting gift for each of you.
但我们为你们每一个人准备了一份可爱的告别礼物。

839
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,510
SPEAKER: Thank you.
演讲者：谢谢。

841
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,180
DAVID J. MALAN: Thank you for volunteering.
戴维·J·马兰：感谢你的志愿服务。

00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:08,980
SPEAKER: Thanks.
演讲者：谢谢。

843
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,897
DAVID J. MALAN: You might need to share it with the folks next to you.
戴维·J·马兰：你可能需要与你旁边的人分享。

844
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:15,106
[CHATTER]
[聊天声]

845
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,470
Oop, here we go.
哦，开始了。

846

DAVID J. MALAN: --so much.
戴维·J·马兰：——非常感谢。

851
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,250

[APPLAUSE]
[掌声]

854
00:37:24,734 --> 00:37:26,120
Did you lose something?
你丢了什么东西吗？

855
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,490
OK.
好的。

856
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,030
All right.
好的。

857
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:31,190
So, [LAUGHS] Spot's had it.
所以，[笑声] 斑点已经够了。

858
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:34,060
So let's see, then, if we've solved, now,
所以让我们看看，然后，如果我们已经解决了，现在，

859
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,640
the problem of representing English letters of the alphabet,
用英语字母表来代表字母的问题，

860
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,850
being able to spell out words like "bow," B-O-W. What if we actually do
能够拼出像“bow”这样的词，B-O-W。如果我们实际上有

861
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,210
have accented characters?
有重音字符？

862
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:43,883
What if we do have other glyphs that we want to represent?
如果我们确实有我们想要表示的其他字形呢？

863
00:37:43,883 --> 00:37:47,050
Well, here, of course, is a standard US English keyboard, which a lot of you
当然，这里有一个标准的美国英语键盘，你们很多人都

864
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:47,650
might have.
可能拥有。

865
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:50,260
But there's also characters that you can type much more
但也有你可以输入得更方便的字符

866
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,930
easily if you have a foreign keyboard, relative to the US,
如果你有一个外国键盘，与美国相比，更容易输入，

867
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:55,780
or with certain keystrokes on your own Mac, PC, and phone.
或者在你的Mac、PC和手机上使用特定的按键。

868
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:59,230
But, nowadays, too, there's this menu that, probably, you've
但是，现在，还有这个菜单，可能你已经

869
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:03,400
used in the past hour or two to actually send some emoji.
在一两小时前使用过，来实际发送一些表情符号。

870
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,040
An emoji, even though they look like pictures
表情符号，即使它们看起来像图片

871
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,080
and they actually are pictures on the screen,
而且它们实际上就是屏幕上的图片，

872
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:13,120
they're, technically, just characters, characters of an emoji alphabet
从技术上讲，它们只是字符，表情符号字母表的字符

873
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,330
that happened to use a certain pattern of 0's and 1's to represent
恰好使用了0和1的特定模式来表示

874
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:19,880
each of these faces, each of these people, and places, and things.
所有这些面孔，所有这些人，所有这些地方，所有这些东西。

875
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,540
And it turns out that one of the reasons that we have just
事实证明，我们现在有如此多[笑声]字符的原因之一是，我们现在

876
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:29,240
so many [LAUGHS] such characters nowadays is because we now
使用Unicode而不是ASCII。

877
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,370
use Unicode instead of ASCII.
使用Unicode而不是ASCII。

878
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:34,370
So Unicode is a superset, so to speak, of ASCII,
所以Unicode可以被认为是ASCII的超集，

879
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:38,030
which is to say that we, humans, realized, some time ago, that just
也就是说，我们人类在很久以前就意识到了，仅仅

880
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,370
using eight bits to represent letters of the alphabet
使用八位来表示字母表中的字母

881
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:43,070
certainly isn't very good when we want to represent
当我们想表示其他非英语语言时，肯定不太好。

882
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,960
other, non-English languages.
其他非英语语言。

883
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,240
So Unicode doesn't just use eight bits.
所以Unicode不仅仅使用八位。

884
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:52,520
It sometimes uses 16 bits per character, sometimes 24 bits per character,
它有时使用每个字符16位，有时使用每个字符24位，

885
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,610
and sometimes even 32 bits per character.
有时甚至使用每个字符32位。

886
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,690
Now, why those numbers?
现在，为什么是这些数字呢？

887
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:00,680
That's just one byte, two bytes, three bytes, or four bytes.
这只是 1 个字节、2 个字节、3 个字节或 4 个字节。

888
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,132
And that gives us--
这给了我们——

889
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:02,840
does anyone know?
有人知道吗？

890
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,380
That gives us the ability to represent as many as 4
这让我们能够表示多达 4

891
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,630
billion possible characters.
0 亿种可能的字符。

892
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:12,150
Because if the longest one is 32 bits, that's 2 to the 32,
因为如果最长的一个是 32 位，那就是 2 的 32 次方，

893
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:15,090
which, if you do out the math, trust me, is roughly 4 billion.
相信我，如果你算一下，大约是 40 亿。

894
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,430
So that's a lot of characters.
所以有很多字符。

895
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,040
And we've got a lot of room, then, for these emoji.
那么，我们就有很多空间来存放这些表情符号。

896
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,130
But it's not just about having fun, pictorially, on the screen.
但这不仅仅是为了在屏幕上以图片形式玩得开心。

897
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:27,830
Unicode's mission really is to represent and to preserve all human languages
Unicode 的使命实际上是代表和保留所有人类语言，

898
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:31,530
digitally, both past, present, and future.
以数字形式，无论过去、现在还是将来。

899
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:35,420
So it is really about capturing the entirety of human knowledge,
所以它实际上是关于捕捉人类知识的全部，

900
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,430
as we've expressed it in language, but also
正如我们用语言表达的那样，但也是

901
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:42,020
giving this newfound ability that's been used centuries ago, too-- in writings,
赋予这种新发现的能力，这种能力几个世纪前就已被使用——在文字中，

902
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,300
on walls, and the like-- pictograms via which
在墙壁上等等——象形文字，通过它

903
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,640
we can still communicate, even independently
我们仍然可以交流，即使是独立

904
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,030
of our own human language.
于我们自己的语言。

905
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:51,320
So we'll reduce it, today, to just patterns of 0's and 1's, but
所以我们今天把它简化为 0 和 1 的模式，但

906
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:56,190
the problem being solved is much greater and well-beyond CS, itself, there.
正在解决的问题要大得多，远远超出了 CS 本身。

907
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,610
So here is a pattern of 0's and 1's using
所以这里有一个使用 0 和 1 的模式，

908
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:04,310
Unicode, so more than eight bits, that represents a very popular emoji, which
Unicode，超过 8 位，它代表着一个非常受欢迎的表情符号，它

909
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,090
might be a bit of a hint.
可能有点提示。

910
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:08,870
This is the most popular emoji, as of last year, at least,
至少到去年为止，这是最受欢迎的表情符号，

911
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,330
statistically, internationally.
从统计上来说，在国际上。

912
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:13,078
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
[插话声音]

913
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,370
DAVID J. MALAN: Does this help?
大卫·J·马兰：这有帮助吗？

914
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,520
It's, roughly, this number here.
它大约是这里这个数字。

915
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,240
No?
没有？

916
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,080
It's this one here.
是这里这个。

917
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:23,360
So this is the most popular emoji, by most measures, as of last year.
所以，根据大多数标准，这是去年最受欢迎的表情符号。

918
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,170
But it doesn't always look like this.
但它并不总是这个样子。

919
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,190
Those of you who have a Mac or an iPhone recognize this symbol, perhaps,
你们中那些拥有 Mac 或 iPhone 的人可能认识这个符号，

920
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:28,690
immediately.
马上就认出来了。

921
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:31,100
Those of you with Android devices or other platforms
你们中那些使用 Android 设备或其他平台的人

922
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:35,310
might notice that it's the same idea, but it's a little bit different.
可能会注意到它表达的是同一个意思，但略有不同。

923
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:38,660
And this is because, too, emojis, at the end of the day,
而这也是因为，归根结底，表情符号

924
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,420
just represent character, but those characters can be drawn,
只代表字符，但这些字符可以被绘制，

925
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,070
can be painted in different ways.
可以用不同的方式来描绘。

926
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:46,130
And reasonable people will interpret differently
而且合理的人会对这个表情符号有不同的解释，它官方的名字是“流着泪的笑脸”。

927
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:49,880
this emoji, whose official name is "face with tears of joy."
而且，的确，谷歌对它的解释与苹果、微软、Meta 以及其他公司都略有不同。

928
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,130
And, indeed, Google interprets it a little differently
你可以把这些不同的公司想象成拥有不同的表情符号字体。

929
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:55,813
from Apple, versus Microsoft, versus Meta, versus other companies, as well.
这确实开始把它们与文本和字符的世界联系起来。

930
00:40:55,813 --> 00:40:57,980
So you can almost think of those different companies
所以，你只是为了让你见过它。

931
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,230
as having different fonts for emoji.
下次再说这个吧。

932
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:04,160
And that really starts to connect things to the world of text and characters.
事实证明，表情符号，以及更普遍的字符，

933
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,720
So, just so you've seen it.
我们不使用二进制 0 和 1 来表示它们，

934
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,110
More on this, another time.
因为包括我在内，没有人会认出哪个是哪个。

935
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:10,980
It turns out that emoji and, really, characters, in general,
数学太复杂了。

936
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,430
we don't use binary 0's and 1's to represent them
它毫无趣味。

937
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,740
because no one, myself included, is going to recognize what's what.
即使是十进制数字——是 40 亿还是其他的——

938
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,520
It's just too much math.
我记不住哪个数字是哪个。

939
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,480
It's not interesting.
所以我们用更紧凑的方式来表示事物。

940
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,880
And even decimal numbers-- that was 4 billion or some--
诚然，这看起来仍然很神秘，

941
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,260
I don't remember which number is which.
但这是使用另一种数学系统，

942
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,410
So we represent things a little more compactly.
称为 16 进制或十六进制的 Unicode 代码点。

943
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:26,510
And this, too, admittedly, still looks cryptic,
下次再说这个吧。

944
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:30,770
but this is a Unicode code point that uses another system, mathematically,
但这仅仅是一种以更简洁的方式表示数字的方法，

945
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:33,470
called base-16 or hexadecimal.
在屏幕上写得更少，因为你不仅使用 0

946
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,670
More on that, another time.
到 9，就像十进制一样。

947
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:38,090
But it's just a way of representing numbers even more succinctly,
但你也在使用 A 到 F，所以英语字母表中的一些字母也参与进来。

948
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:41,270
writing less on the screen, because you're using not just 0
但现在，对于那些关心的人来说，这更容易记忆，

949
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,590
through 9, as in decimal.
因为，那个数字代表着“流着泪的笑脸”。

950
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:46,010
But you're using A through F, as well, so a few letters
但如果我们想要一个自定义的表情符号呢？

951
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,670
of the English alphabet come into play.
这种情况越来越多。

952
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,700
But, for now, that's just a little easier
例如，这里有 5 种肤色，

953
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,750
to remember, too, for people who care, that that is the number that
如今，手机、笔记本电脑和台式电脑都支持这些肤色。

954
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,880
represents "face with tears of joy."
它基于一种叫做“菲茨帕特里克量表”的东西，

955
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,010
But what if we want a customized emoji?
它本质上将人类肤色分为 6 类，或者在本例中，

956
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,780
And this, increasingly, is the case.
分为 5 类，从浅到深。

957
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,910
Here, for instance, are the five skin tones
但这表明，哇，如果我们想用这 5 种不同的肤色来表示人，

958
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:04,760
that phones, and laptops, and desktops, nowadays, support.
这可能会大大增加我们需要的每种可能面孔的 0 和 1 的唯一模式的数量。

959
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,802
It's based on something called the "Fitzpatrick scale," which essentially
但如果我们从工程的角度来看，

960
00:42:07,802 --> 00:42:10,460
categorizes human skin tone into six or, in this case, five
我们实际上可以把肤色看作是对某个默认颜色的修改，

961
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,560
different categories, from lighter to darker.
无论好坏。

962
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,480
But this suggests that, wow, if we want to represent people
而黄色是事实上的默认颜色，辛普森风格。

963
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,040
with five different skin tones, like this, that could significantly
但为了把它修改得看起来更像人类，从浅到深，

964
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,130
increase how many unique patterns of 0's and 1's we
也许我们只使用相同的位模式，

965
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,890
need for every possible face.
来表示一个人的拇指，例如，竖起拇指或竖起大拇指。

966
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,540
But if we think about it from an engineering perspective,
然后我们只需修改那个字符，使其以不同的肤色显示出来。

967
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:33,068
we can actually just think of skin tone as modifying some default
例如，这里就是你在不同平台上可能使用的“竖起大拇指”。

968
00:42:33,068 --> 00:42:34,360
color, for better or for worse.
让我声明一下，这是一个 Unicode 代码点。

969
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,450
And yellow is the de facto default, Simpson style.
它是 Mac、PC 和手机在后台用来表示默认黄色“竖起大拇指”的数字。

970
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:41,350
But to modify it to look more genuinely human-like, from lighter to darker,
但如果你想给它一个中等肤色，

971
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,990
well, maybe we just use the same pattern of bits
你仍然使用相同的数字，相同的 0 和 1 的模式，

972
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:47,720
to represent a human thumb, for instance, thumbs up or thumbs down.
来表示“竖起大拇指”。

973
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,210
And we just, then, modify that character to be displayed with a different skin
所以，下次再说吧。

974
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:51,710
tone.
我们会在下节课中讨论这些话题。

975
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,950
So, for instance, here, then, is the "thumbs up"
所以，下次再说吧。

976
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,750
that you might use on various platforms.
我们会在下节课中讨论这些话题。

977
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:59,200
And let me just stipulate that this is the Unicode code point.
所以，下次再说吧。

978
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,870
That is the number that Macs, PCs, and phones
我们会在下节课中讨论这些话题。

979
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:05,960
use underneath the hood to represent the default yellow "thumbs up."
我们会在下节课中讨论这些话题。

980
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,770
But if you want to give it a medium skin tone,
我们会在下节课中讨论这些话题。

981
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:12,370
you still use that same number, that same pattern of 0's and 1's,
我们会在下节课中讨论这些话题。

982
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:13,930
or switches, underneath the hood.
或者开关，在引擎盖下面。

983
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:17,620
But you use a few more switches that the computer or phone
但是你用更多开关，让电脑或手机

984
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,800
will interpret as, "Oh, you don't want to see the default in yellow
会解释为，“哦，你不想要看到默认的黄色

985
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,890
because of this second number that's in the computer's memory somewhere.
因为这个第二个数字存在于电脑的内存中的某个地方。”

986
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:27,170
You want me to adjust it to be the medium skin tone or any
你想让我调整它，让它变成中等肤色，或任何

987
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,010
of the other values, instead."
其他值，而不是。”

988
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,580
So that's the engineering solution to this problem
所以这就是这个问题的工程解决方案

989
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:35,078
of just trying to represent different ranges of emoji here.
只是试图在这里表示不同的表情符号范围。

990
00:43:35,078 --> 00:43:36,620
Well, what about something like this?
好吧，像这样的东西呢？

991
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,480
There's a lot more combinatorics, nowadays,
现在，你的键盘上有很多组合，

992
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,522
on your keyboard for relationships, for instance.
比如，用于表示关系。

993
00:43:40,522 --> 00:43:43,620
So here is a "couple with heart" here.
所以这里有一个“带心心的情侣”。

994
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:46,520
So the couple, here, of course, is represented with, apparently,
所以这对情侣，当然，用这个数字表示，显然，

995
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,600
this number here.
是这个数字。

996
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,255
But that's it.
但就是这样。

997
00:43:48,255 --> 00:43:50,630
But if you want to be more specific-- like man and woman,
但是如果你想更具体一点 - 比如男人和女人，

998
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:53,240
or man-man, woman-woman-- it's the same idea,
或者男人男人，女人女人 - 都是一样的想法，

999
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,630
but we just need to express ourselves a little-- with a little
我们只需要稍微表达一下自己 - 用一点点

1000
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:57,600
more information.
更多信息。

1001
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,560
So, for instance, the way the Unicode folks came up with,
例如，Unicode 的人几年前想出来的表示方法是，

1002
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,830
years ago, to represent, for instance, a woman with a heart and a man,
比如一个女人带心心和一个男人，

1003
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:06,480
from left to right, would be using these values.
从左到右，会用这些值。

1004
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,900
So things just escalated quickly, but only
所以事情迅速升级，但只是

1005
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,560
in the sense that we're using more bits, more 0's and 1's, to represent,
从某种意义上说，我们正在使用更多的比特，更多的 0 和 1 来表示，

1006
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,470
more expressively, this particular combination.
更具表现力地表达这个特定的组合。

1007
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:18,050
So this happens to be the number in Unicode
所以这个数字恰好是 Unicode 中

1008
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,790
that represents the woman at left.
表示左边女人的那个数字。

1009
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,430
This is the number that represents the man at right.
这是表示右边男人的数字。

1010
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:25,160
And this is the pair of numbers that represents
而这两个数字代表

1011
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:29,550
the heart in the middle, sometimes red, sometimes pink, displayed here as pink.
中间的心，有时是红色，有时是粉色，这里显示为粉色。

1012
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:32,510
But if we want to change the combination, for instance, to be,
但是如果我们想改变这个组合，例如，变成

1013
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:33,920
say, woman--
比如，女人 -

1014
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,320
if we want to change the combination to be woman-woman,
如果我们想把这个组合改成女人女人，

1015
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,200
notice that, now, the left and the rightmost numbers match.
注意，现在，最左边和最右边的数字匹配了。

1016
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,290
Or if we flip it back to man-man, it's just using different numbers
或者如果我们把它翻转回男人男人，它只是用不同的数字

1017
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:43,790
on the tail end again.
在结尾处再次。

1018
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:48,380
And meanwhile, if I rewind, there's these two identical values here.
同时，如果我倒带，这里有两个相同的数值。

1019
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:51,680
These are called zero-width joiners or ZWNJ characters.
这些叫做零宽度连接符或 ZWNJ 字符。

1020
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,460
It just is a special number that humans reserve to say,
它只是一个特殊的数字，人类保留下来说，

1021
00:44:55,460 --> 00:45:00,210
glue the emoji at the left to the emoji on the right and so forth.
把左边的表情符号粘到右边的表情符号上，依此类推。

1022
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,370
So it connects ideas in this way.
所以它以这种方式连接想法。

1023
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:04,490
So there's actually a lot of emojis, nowadays,
所以现在有很多表情符号，

1024
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:07,370
that are a combination of different things.
它们是不同事物的组合。

1025
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:09,650
"Heart on fire" is one that's, technically,
“燃烧的心”就是一个，从技术上来说，

1026
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:13,190
the combination of a heart emoji, the fire emoji,
是心形表情符号和火焰表情符号的组合，

1027
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:16,110
joined together, numerically, in this way.
以这种方式在数字上连接在一起。

1028
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:18,290
So computer scientists who come up with these things
所以那些想出这些东西的计算机科学家

1029
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:21,290
are just reducing things to representations.
只是将事物简化为表示。

1030
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:23,430
All we have at our disposal are 0's and 1's.
我们所能利用的只有 0 和 1。

1031
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,250
So we all just need to agree, ultimately--
所以我们都需要达成一致，最终 -

1032
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:28,760
whether we're Google, Microsoft, or the like-- how we're going to standardize
无论是谷歌，微软，还是其他类似公司 - 我们将如何标准化

1033
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,030
these kinds of things as information.
这些信息。

1034
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:36,520
Questions, then, on how characters are represented in a computer,
那么，关于字符如何在电脑中表示，

1035
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,260
be it English or any other language?
无论是英语还是任何其他语言？

1036
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:38,760
Yeah.
是的。

1037
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,630
AUDIENCE: How is the plus a number?
观众：加号怎么是一个数字呢？

1038
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:41,963
DAVID J. MALAN: How is the what?
大卫·J·马兰：什么怎么是数字？

1039
00:45:41,963 --> 00:45:43,930
AUDIENCE: The plus, the U+.
观众：加号，U+。

1040
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:46,600
DAVID J. MALAN: Oh, the U+ is just a convention, really.
大卫·J·马兰：哦，U+ 只是一个约定，真的。

1041
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,820
So U+ represents a special Unicode character,
所以 U+ 代表一个特殊的 Unicode 字符，

1042
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,790
which is a U with a plus in the middle.
它是一个中间有加号的 U。

1043
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,590
And this is just the convention for saying,
而这只是一个约定，用于表示，

1044
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:58,600
hey, everyone, here comes a number that represents a Unicode code point.
嘿，大家好，这里有一个数字，它代表一个 Unicode 码点。

1045
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,070
The U and the 1 have no-- sorry.
U 和 1 没有 - 对不起。

1046
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:02,278
The U and the plus have no mathematical significance.
U 和加号没有数学意义。

1047
00:46:02,278 --> 00:46:05,470
It's just a visual clue to folks.
它只是一个视觉提示。

1048
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:10,460
Other questions on representing text in this way?
关于以这种方式表示文本的其他问题？

1049
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:10,960
All right.
好的。

1050
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,240
So what about colors?
那么颜色呢？

1051
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,990
We've already started looking at pictures.
我们已经开始看图片了。

1052
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:17,032
Well, how are those pictures, be it emojis or anything else, represented?
那么，那些图片，无论是表情符号还是其他任何东西，是如何表示的呢？

1053
00:46:17,032 --> 00:46:19,870
One of the most common ways is just with RGB--
最常见的方法之一就是用 RGB -

1054
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:20,950
red, green, and blue.
红，绿，蓝。

1055
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:24,700
It turns out that if we just keep track of how much red should
事实证明，如果我们只记录屏幕上应该有多少红色，

1056
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:27,880
be on the screen, and how much green, and how much blue, combined together,
有多少绿色，有多少蓝色，组合在一起，

1057
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,890
that gives us every color of the rainbow,
就能得到彩虹中的所有颜色，

1058
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,120
from white to black and everything in between.
从白色到黑色，以及介于两者之间的所有颜色。

1059
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,620
So how do we represent an amount of red, and green, and blue?
那么我们如何表示红色、绿色和蓝色的数量呢？

1060
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,690
Well, frankly, just with three different numbers.
坦白地说，就用三个不同的数字。

1061
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:40,030
And this is how computers typically represent colors.
这就是电脑通常表示颜色的方式。

1062
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:43,220
Every one of the dots on your computer screen or your phone screen
电脑屏幕或手机屏幕上的每一个点

1063
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:44,390
is called a pixel.
被称为像素。

1064
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:50,130
And every single dot underneath the hood has three numbers associated with it,
而每个点在引擎盖下面都有三个数字与之关联，

1065
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:53,000
so three numbers, three numbers, three numbers for every little dot.
所以每个小点都有三个数字，三个数字，三个数字。

1066
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,420
And those three numbers, together, say how much red, green, and blue
而这三个数字加在一起，表示在那个位置应该显示多少红色、绿色和蓝色。

1067
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,040
should the device display at that location.
设备应该显示在那个位置。

1068
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,390
So, for instance, if you had a dot on your screen
例如，如果你的屏幕上有一个点

1069
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:07,520
that said, "use this much red, this much green this much blue," because each
说：“用这么多红色，这么多绿色，这么多蓝色，”因为每个

1070
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,820
of these numbers, I'll tell you, are one byte or eight bits,
这些数字，我会告诉你，都是一个字节或八个比特，

1071
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:15,710
which means the total possible values is 0 to 255--
这意味着可能的总值为 0 到 255 -

1072
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:19,070
let me just ballpark that the 72, it feels like a medium amount of red
让我随便说一下，72 感觉像是中等量的红色

1073
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,350
because it's in between 0 and 255.
因为它介于 0 和 255 之间。

1074
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:25,590
73 is a medium amount of green, and 33 of blue is just a little bit.
73 是中等量的绿色，而 33 的蓝色只是一点点。

1075
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:29,480
So if you combine a medium amount of red, green, and a little bit of blue,
所以如果你把中等量的红色、绿色和一点点蓝色混合在一起，

1076
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,840
anyone want to guess what color of the rainbow this is?
有人想猜猜彩虹中的这种颜色吗？

1077
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:33,507
AUDIENCE: Brown.
观众：棕色。

1078
00:47:33,507 --> 00:47:34,423
DAVID J. MALAN: Sorry?
大卫·J·马兰：你说什么？

1079
00:47:34,423 --> 00:47:35,190
AUDIENCE: Brown.
观众：棕色。

1080
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:36,470
DAVID J. MALAN: Brown?
大卫·J·马兰：棕色？

1081
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:37,228
So, close.
所以，差不多。

1082
00:47:37,228 --> 00:47:39,020
It's a little more yellow than it is brown.
它比棕色更偏黄一点。

1083
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,920
But if we combine them, it looks a little something like this.
但如果我们把它们结合起来，看起来会有点像这样。

1084
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,887
This is just CS trivia, not something that even
这只是计算机科学的琐事，而不是我甚至

1085
00:47:43,887 --> 00:47:46,970
I would be able to eyeball, unless I came up with that particular example.
能够凭肉眼看出来的，除非我自己想出了那个特定的例子。

1086
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:48,607
But wait a minute.
等等。

1087
00:47:48,607 --> 00:47:49,940
We've seen these numbers before.
我们以前见过这些数字。

1088
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,768
72, 73, 33 represented what--
72、73、33 代表什么——

1089
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:52,310
AUDIENCE: Hi!
观众：你好！

1090
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:53,370
DAVID J. MALAN: --a few minutes ago?
大卫·J·马兰：——几分钟前？

1091
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,787
So it meant "Hi!" but here I am, claiming, no, no, no, no,
所以它意味着“你好！”，但现在我说，不，不，不，不，

1092
00:47:55,787 --> 00:47:57,140
that means yellow.
那是黄色。

1093
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,890
How do you reconcile this?
你怎么解释这个？

1094
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:01,550
Well, at the end of the day, this is all we have,
好吧，归根结底，这就是我们拥有的全部，

1095
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:04,310
0's and 1's, whether you think of them as numbers,
0 和 1，无论你把它们看作数字，

1096
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:06,620
or letters, or even colors now.
还是字母，甚至现在的颜色。

1097
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:08,400
But it depends on the context.
但这取决于上下文。

1098
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,390
So if you've received a text message or an email,
所以，如果你收到了一条短信或一封电子邮件，

1099
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:13,850
odds are the pattern of 0's and 1's that the computer
很可能计算机显示给你的 0 和 1 的模式将被解释为文本，因为那是

1100
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:17,300
is showing you are going to be interpreted as text because that's
短信或电子邮件的全部意义所在。

1101
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,940
the whole point of a text message or an email.
如果，不过，你打开了 MacOS、iOS、Windows 或者 Android 的

1102
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:23,930
If, though, you opened up MacOS's or iOS's or Windows's or Android's
计算器应用程序，相同的 0 和 1 的模式可能会

1103
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:27,230
calculator app, the same pattern of 0's and 1's might
被解释为数字，用于进行加法、减法或其他运算。

1104
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:30,650
be interpreted as numbers for some addition, or subtraction, or whatever.
如果你在 Photoshop 中打开相同的 0 和 1 的模式，

1105
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:33,780
If you open the same pattern of 0's and 1's in Photoshop,
比如在图形程序中，它们将在那个上下文中被解释为

1106
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:37,110
like a graphics program, they're going to be interpreted, in that context,
颜色。

1107
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:37,950
as colors.
所以上下文很重要。

1108
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:39,098
So context matters.
而且，实际上，从下周开始，当你

1109
00:48:39,098 --> 00:48:40,890
And, indeed, as soon as next week, when you
开始使用名为 C 的语言编写代码时，

1110
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:43,080
start writing code in that language called C,
你将有责任告诉计算机，将

1111
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,550
the onus will be on you, the programmer, to tell the computer, interpret
以下位序列解释为数字、字母或其他东西。

1112
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:52,593
the following sequence of bits as a number, or a letter, or something else.
你甚至不必担心 0 和 1 是什么，

1113
00:48:52,593 --> 00:48:55,260
And you won't have to even worry about what the 0's and 1's are,
但你需要给计算机一个提示，说明你正在表示什么类型的文件

1114
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,380
but you need to give the computer a hint as to what type of file
或数据片段。

1115
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,730
or piece of data you're representing.
所以，这就是位。

1116
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:01,890
So that gives us bits.
而且你实际上可以在屏幕上看到这些点，这些像素。

1117
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:05,640
And you can actually see these dots, these pixels on the screen.
让我放大，放大。

1118
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,380
Let me zoom in, zoom in.
我们在这里看到了，只是这个表情符号，归根结底，

1119
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,470
And here we have it, just with this emoji, which, at the end of the day,
是苹果公司的人在这种情况下的一个图画。

1120
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:13,380
is a picture that someone at Apple, in this case, drew.
如果你真的放大，或者拿起你的手机或电视

1121
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,440
And you can see-- if you really zoom in, or take your phone or TV
把它放在你脸前，你会看到所有这些点，

1122
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,470
and really put it close to your face, you'll see all of these dots,
这取决于硬件。

1123
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:20,700
depending on the hardware.
每个点，每个方块，都是

1124
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,250
And each of these dots, these squares, is
存储 24 位或 3 个字节，24 位，24 位，24 位。

1125
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:28,350
storing 24 bits or three bytes, 24 bits, 24 bits, 24 bits.
这就是为什么，点，点，点，如果你有

1126
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:31,200
And that's whey, dot, dot, dot, if you've
比如一张照片，是 3 兆字节，也就是

1127
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,730
got a photograph, for instance, that's three megabytes, which
300 万字节，那么很可能里面有 100 万像素，

1128
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:42,030
is 3 million bytes, well, odds are there's 1 million pixels therein
因为你每个像素使用 3 个字节

1129
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:45,240
because you're using three bytes per pixel
来表示每个颜色。

1130
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,708
to represent each of those colors.
这有点过于简化了，但这

1131
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:48,750
That's a bit of an oversimplification, but that's
就是为什么图像和照片现在越来越大。

1132
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:51,840
why images and photos are getting bigger and bigger nowadays.
因为我们在文件中添加了更多的像素。

1133
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:56,110
Because we're throwing even more pixels into the file.
音乐——

1134
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:56,610
Music--
[音乐播放]

1135
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:57,330
[MUSIC PLAYING]
——你如何用数字的方式表示音乐，

1136
00:49:57,330 --> 00:49:59,880
--how could you represent music, digitally,
只用 0 和 1，或者说数字，来表示？

1137
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,920
using just 0's and 1's, or numbers, really?
任何直觉，无论是音乐家还是非音乐家？

1138
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,710
Any instinct, whether a musician or not?
是的。

1139
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:08,743
Yeah.
观众：音符可以用数字来表示。

1140
00:50:08,743 --> 00:50:11,060
AUDIENCE: The notes could be represented by a number.
大卫·J·马兰：是的，所以我们可以用数字来表示音符。

1141
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,768
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, so we can just represent notes by a number.
所以 A 是一个数字，B 也是。也许升调或降调是另一个数字。

1142
00:50:13,768 --> 00:50:17,660
So A is some number, and B. And maybe sharp or flat is some other number.
但音符可能不足以表达一些——

1143
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:21,610
But note might not be quite enough for some--
是的？

1144
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:22,110
yeah?
观众：[听不清]

1145
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:22,876
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
大卫·J·马兰：啊，好的。

1146
00:50:22,876 --> 00:50:23,834
DAVID J. MALAN: Ah, OK.
所以一个音符——一个数字来表示音符本身，

1147
00:50:23,834 --> 00:50:26,470
So one note-- one number to represent the note, itself,
声音或音高；另一个数字来表示持续时间。

1148
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:30,820
the sound or the pitch; one other number to represent the duration.
在钢琴的语境中，演奏者按下琴键的时间有多长？

1149
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:35,000
In the context of piano, how long is the human holding the key down?
也许我可以再想一个，响度。

1150
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,330
And maybe I can think of a third, the loudness.
演奏者弹奏那个音符的力度有多大？

1151
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:39,457
How hard has the person played that note?
所以，至少用三个数字，你可以

1152
00:50:39,457 --> 00:50:41,290
So, minimally, with three numbers, you could
想象用这种方式来表示音乐。

1153
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,492
imagine representing music, as well.
而且，实际上，当你在听声音时，计算机很可能就是这样做的。

1154
00:50:43,492 --> 00:50:45,700
And, indeed, that's very well might be what computers
视频呢？

1155
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,720
are doing when you listen to sound.
你如何用数字来表示视频？

1156
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,610
What about video?
是的？

1157
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:51,760
How could you represent videos, as well?
观众：通过很多图像。

1158
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,270
Yeah?
大卫·J·马兰：是的，很多图像。

1159
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:53,460
AUDIENCE: Through many images.
所以，如果你曾经制作过电影或者看过一些小字说明，

1160
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,790
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, many images.
每秒 30 帧，FPS，或每秒 29 帧

1161
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:57,750
So if you've ever produced a film or looked at some of the fine print,
只是说明了屏幕上每秒播放多少张图片。

1162
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:02,070
30 frames per second, FPS, or 29 frames per second
但实际上，这就是计算机上视频文件的所有内容，

1163
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:04,560
is just how many pictures are flying across the screen.
很多图片以极快的速度在你我眼前移动，以至于我们的大脑

1164
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,810
But that's really all a video file is on a computer,
把它解释为实际的运动。

1165
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:10,470
lots of pictures moving so quickly in front of us that you and I, our brains,
实际上，从前，电影，

1166
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:12,930
interpolate that as being actual motion.
就像那些给予运动错觉的图片，

1167
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:15,720
And, in fact, from yesteryear, motion pictures,
即使屏幕上每秒只有 30 张左右的图片在移动。

1168
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,570
it's like pictures that are giving the illusion of motion,
所以，现在我们有了一种方法来表示信息，无论是作为

1169
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:21,910
even though there's only 30 or so of them flying across the screen.
输入还是输出，无论是数字、字母、图像，还是其他任何东西。

1170
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:24,870
So we have a way, now, to represent information, both as
现在，让我们把注意力集中在那个黑盒子里，

1171
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:29,250
input and output, whether it's numbers, letters, images, anything else.
可以说是，我们在那里有算法，一步一步的指令。

1172
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:32,200
Let's now focus on what's inside of that black box,


1173
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:36,360
so to speak, wherein we have algorithms, step-by-step instructions
可以这么说，我们有算法，一步一步的指令

1174
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,430
for solving some problem.
用于解决一些问题。

1175
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:41,760
Now, what do I mean by "algorithms" or "step-by-step instructions"?
现在，“算法”或“分步指令”是什么意思？

1176
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,815
Well, maybe, if we were to turn this into code--
好吧，也许，如果我们要把它变成代码——

1177
00:51:44,815 --> 00:51:47,190
and that's how we'll connect the dots, ultimately, today.
这就是我们最终将要连接这些点的办法，今天。

1178
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:51,480
Code is just the implementation, in computers, of algorithms.
代码只是在计算机中实现算法。

1179
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,920
An algorithm can be something we do in the physical world.
算法可以是我们现实世界中所做的事情。

1180
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,180
Code is how we implement that exact same idea, in the context of a computer,
代码是我们如何在计算机环境下实现相同的想法，

1181
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:58,810
instead.
而不是。

1182
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:02,152
And here, for instance, is a very common application inside of a computer,
举个例子，这里是在电脑中非常常见的应用，

1183
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:02,860
for your context.
对于你的情况来说。

1184
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:04,900
This is the iOS version of the icon.
这是 iOS 版本的图标。

1185
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,963
And, typically, if you click on that icon,
而且，通常情况下，如果你点击那个图标，

1186
00:52:06,963 --> 00:52:09,130
you'll see something like all of your contacts here,
你将看到类似于你所有联系人的内容，

1187
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:12,250
typically, alphabetical, by first name or last name.
通常情况下，按姓或名进行字母排序。

1188
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:17,103
And your phone or your computer lets you often search for someone's name
你的手机或电脑经常让你可以搜索某人的姓名

1189
00:52:17,103 --> 00:52:17,770
at the very top.
在最上面。

1190
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:20,620
And it will autocomplete, and it'll be pretty darn fast.
它会自动补全，而且速度会很快。

1191
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:23,470
But it'll be pretty darn fast because the programmers who
但它会非常快，因为那些

1192
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:28,210
implemented that application are looking for someone quickly for you.
实现该应用的程序员正在为你快速寻找某人。

1193
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:33,400
Now, I can do this old school style, whereby we have one of these things
现在，我可以使用老式的做法，即使用其中一个东西

1194
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,840
from yesteryear, an actual phone book.
来自过去年代的，一个真正的电话簿。

1195
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:39,160
So, in a physical phone book like this, you might have 1,000 pages.
所以，在这样的一个实体电话簿中，你可能有 1000 页。

1196
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,440
And on every page are a bunch of names and a bunch of numbers.
而且每一页都有很多姓名和电话号码。

1197
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,490
And as I flip through this, I could look for someone specific.
当我翻阅它时，我可以寻找特定的人。

1198
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:49,010
So suppose I want to call John Harvard, who's-- the first name, of course,
假设我想打电话给约翰·哈佛，他是——当然，他的名字是

1199
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:52,720
starts with a J. Well, I could just turn, page by page,
以 J 开头的。好吧，我可以一页一页地翻，

1200
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,590
looking for John Harvard.
寻找约翰·哈佛。

1201
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:57,000
And if he's not there, I keep turning and turning.
如果他不在那里，我继续翻阅。

1202
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
So this is an algorithm.
所以，这就是一个算法。

1203
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,790
I'm stepping through the phone book, one page at a time.
我正在一页一页地翻阅电话簿。

1204
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:04,510
Is it correct, this algorithm, assuming I'm looking down?
这个算法正确吗？假设我在往下看？

1205
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:05,470
So, yeah.
所以，是的。

1206
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:07,930
I mean, it's stupidly slow because why am
我的意思是，它太慢了，因为为什么我

1207
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:10,585
I wasting my time with the A's, and the B's, and the so forth?
浪费时间去看 A、B 以及其他的字母？

1208
00:53:10,585 --> 00:53:12,460
I could probably take bigger bites out of it.
我可能可以更快地找到他。

1209
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,210
But it is correct.
但它是正确的。

1210
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:16,293
And that's going to be one of the goals of writing code, is to, of course,
而编写代码的目标之一就是，当然，

1211
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:18,100
solve the problem you care about correctly.
正确地解决你关心的问题。

1212
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:20,470
So correctness goes without saying, or else what's
所以，正确性是毋庸置疑的，否则写代码或解决问题——或者实现

1213
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:23,080
the point of writing the code or solving-- or implementing
算法的意义何在？

1214
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:23,800
the algorithm?
算法？

1215
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,040
All right.
好的。

1216
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,623
Well, let me at least speed things up.
好吧，至少让我加快速度。

1217
00:53:25,623 --> 00:53:29,380
So, instead of one page at a time, so, two, four, six, eight--
所以，不再是一页一页，而是两页、四页、六页、八页——

1218
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:33,420
no, ignore that-- 10, 12, 14, 16, and so forth.
不，忽略那个——10 页、12 页、14 页、16 页，等等。

1219
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,920
It's a little hard to do, physically, but it sounded faster.
从物理上来说，这有点难，但听起来更快。

1220
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,815
It was twice as fast, theoretically, but is it correct?
理论上，它快了一倍，但它是正确的吗？

1221
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:39,505
AUDIENCE: No.
观众：不。

1222
00:53:39,505 --> 00:53:40,480
DAVID J. MALAN: So, no.
大卫·J·马兰：所以，不。

1223
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,210
Why?
为什么？

1224
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:41,710
Yeah?
是吧？

1225
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:43,180
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you might [INAUDIBLE].
观众：是的，你可能会 [听不清]。

1226
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:46,263
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, I might miss John Harvard because, just by accident,
大卫·J·马兰：是的，我可能会错过约翰·哈佛，因为，只是碰巧，

1227
00:53:46,263 --> 00:53:48,490
he might get sandwiched between two pages.
他可能夹在两页之间。

1228
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:52,210
But do I have to throw the algorithm out altogether?
但是我是否必须完全放弃这个算法？

1229
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:53,260
Probably not.
可能不会。

1230
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:56,073
Once I reach the K section, which is past the J section,
一旦我到达 K 部分，它在 J 部分之后，

1231
00:53:56,073 --> 00:53:58,990
I could double back at least one page, at least, [PATS TELEPHONE BOOK]
我至少可以回退一页，至少，[拍电话簿]

1232
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:01,540
and just make sure I didn't blow past him completely.
并确保我没有完全错过他。

1233
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:04,450
So that is twice as fast, because I'm going two pages
所以它快了一倍，因为我一次翻两页

1234
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,922
at a time, plus one extra step.
再加上一步。

1235
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:07,130
So it's still an improvement.
所以它仍然是一个改进。

1236
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:08,922
So the first algorithm, worst case, if it's
所以第一个算法，最糟糕的情况，如果它不是

1237
00:54:08,922 --> 00:54:10,900
not John, but someone whose name starts with Z,
约翰，而是某个名字以 Z 开头的人，

1238
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,860
that might take me a full 1,000 steps.
这可能需要我 1000 步。

1239
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:16,210
The second algorithm is just 500 steps because I'm
第二个算法只需要 500 步，因为我

1240
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:19,660
going two pages at a time plus one, in case I have to double back,
一次翻两页，再加上一步，以防我不得不回退，

1241
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:20,990
but that's in the worst case.
但这是最糟糕的情况。

1242
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:26,080
But most of us in the-- in yesteryear, and what Apple, and Google, and others
但我们大多数人——在过去年代，以及苹果、谷歌和其他公司

1243
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,440
are actually doing is, in software or here, physically,
实际上正在做的事情是，在软件中或是在这里，在现实中，

1244
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,540
we're typically going, roughly, to the middle.
我们通常会直接翻到中间。

1245
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:34,360
Especially if there's no cheat sheet on the side, like A through Z,
特别是如果没有像 A 到 Z 这样的索引，

1246
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,235
I'm just going to go to, roughly, the middle.
我会直接翻到中间。

1247
00:54:36,235 --> 00:54:38,920
And, oh, here I am, not surprisingly, in the M section.
而且，哦，不出所料，我来到了 M 部分。

1248
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,360
But what do I now know.
但我现在知道了什么。

1249
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,660
If this is the M section, where is John Harvard?
如果这是 M 部分，那么约翰·哈佛在哪里？

1250
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:46,130
So, clearly, to the left, alphabetically.
所以，很明显，在字母顺序上，他应该在左边。

1251
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:49,660
And so here is where we can take a much bigger bite out of the problem.
所以，这里我们可以更快地解决问题。

1252
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:52,480
We can really divide and conquer this problem
我们可以将问题分解，然后逐个解决

1253
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,080
by tearing [TEARS BOOK] the problem in half, throwing half of it
通过撕开 [撕书] 问题的一半，扔掉一半

1254
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:01,240
away, 500 pages away, leaving me with a smaller problem,
500 页，留下一个更小的问题，

1255
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:04,370
half as big, that I can really just now repeat.
规模缩小了一半，我可以重复之前的步骤。

1256
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:07,150
So I go, roughly, here, and now I'm in the E section.
所以，我粗略地翻到这里，现在我来到了 E 部分。

1257
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:09,102
So I went a little too far back.
所以我退得太远了。

1258
00:55:09,102 --> 00:55:10,060
But what do I now know?
但我现在知道了什么？

1259
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,680
If this is the E pages, where's John?
如果这是 E 部分，那么约翰在哪里？

1260
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,460
AUDIENCE: To the right.
观众：在右边。

1261
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:13,690
DAVID J. MALAN: So now he's to the right.
大卫·J·马兰：所以现在他在右边。

1262
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:15,815
So I can-- again, hopefully, he's not on that page.
所以我——再次，希望他不在那页。

1263
00:55:15,815 --> 00:55:20,380
I can tear the problem in half again, throw that 250 pages away.
我再次将问题分成两半，扔掉 250 页。

1264
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:23,530
And now I've gone from 1,000 to 500 to 250 pages.
现在我已经从 1000 页减少到了 500 页，再减少到了 250 页。

1265
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:26,470
Now I'm moving because the first algorithm was one page at a time,
现在我正在移动，因为第一个算法是一页一页地翻，

1266
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:27,280
second was two.
第二个是两页两页地翻。

1267
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,373
This is hundreds of pages at a time.
现在是一次翻几百页。

1268
00:55:29,373 --> 00:55:31,540
And if I go, roughly, again, to the middle; roughly,
如果我再次粗略地翻到中间，粗略地

1269
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:33,790
to the middle; roughly, to the middle, hopefully, I'll
翻到中间，粗略地翻到中间，希望我会

1270
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:36,350
find John Harvard on one final page.
最终在某一页找到约翰·哈佛。

1271
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:39,140
Can only do this once, but one final page.
只能做一次，但只剩最后一页了。

1272
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:42,010
So that invites the question, I would think,
我想这会引出一个问题，

1273
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:44,680
if the phone book does have 1,000 or so pages,
如果电话簿真的有1000页左右，

1274
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:50,210
how many times can I divide the problem in half to get down to one last page?
我需要将问题分成几半才能得到最后一页？

1275
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:51,580
So it's, roughly, 10.
所以大约是10次。

1276
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:56,203
And the quick math is 1,000 goes to 500 to 250 to 125 to 67 something.
快速计算一下，1000变成500，变成250，变成125，变成67左右。

1277
00:55:56,203 --> 00:55:58,370
So we have to deal with rounding issues, eventually.
所以我们最终需要处理舍入问题。

1278
00:55:58,370 --> 00:56:01,640
But assuming we work out the math, it's, roughly, 10 page tears.
但假设我们算出来，大约是10页撕裂。

1279
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:07,580
And that's crazy faster than 1,000 pages and still faster than 500 pages.
这比1000页快多了，也比500页快。

1280
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:09,350
So it's fundamentally better.
所以它从根本上来说更好。

1281
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:13,792
And, indeed, if I finally get to that final page, in the software world,
事实上，如果我最终得到了那最后一页，在软件世界中，

1282
00:56:13,792 --> 00:56:16,250
you'd see something like this, John Harvard and his number,
你会看到这样的东西，约翰·哈佛和他的号码，

1283
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:17,810
which you're welcome to call or text.
你可以随意打电话或发短信。

1284
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:22,850
But that's how we now have our answer, much like the single page there.
但这就是我们现在得到答案的方式，就像那只有一页一样。

1285
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:27,090
But let's consider just how efficient that actually is.
但让我们考虑一下这到底有多高效。

1286
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:30,560
So here's a very rough, broad-- with broad strokes, a chart.
所以这里有一个非常粗略的图表，用粗线条画。

1287
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,998
So here's an xy plot.
所以这里是一个xy图。

1288
00:56:31,998 --> 00:56:34,790
So here, on the horizontal, is going to be the size of the problem.
所以这里，在横轴上，是问题的规模。

1289
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:38,360
And, by that, I mean, how many pages are we trying to go through?
我的意思是，我们试图翻阅多少页？

1290
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,890
This would be zero pages.
这里代表零页。

1291
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:41,480
This would be a lot of pages.
这里代表很多页。

1292
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,610
How much time does it take to solve the problem?
解决这个问题需要多长时间？

1293
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:46,100
How long does it take to find John Harvard or anyone else?
找到约翰·哈佛或其他任何人需要多长时间？

1294
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,540
This means no time.
这里代表不需要时间。

1295
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:48,960
This means a lot of time.
这里代表需要很长时间。

1296
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,110
So what's the relationship among these algorithms?
那么这些算法之间有什么关系呢？

1297
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:53,490
Well, the first one is actually just a straight line.
第一个实际上就是一条直线。

1298
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:57,330
If there's n pages in the phone book, well, I
如果电话簿中有n页，那么我

1299
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:00,060
claim that it's a one-to-one relationship.
声称这是一个一对一的关系。

1300
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:04,290
Because if Verizon or the phone company adds another page next year,
因为如果Verizon或电话公司明年增加了一页，

1301
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:06,900
that just means I might have one more step next year,
那也只意味着我明年可能需要多走一步，

1302
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,990
as well, to find John Harvard or anyone else.
才能找到约翰·哈佛或其他人。

1303
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:12,930
But the second algorithm, it's also a straight line,
但第二个算法也是一条直线，

1304
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,295
but it's lower, even though it might not look obvious.
但它更低，尽管看起来可能不太明显。

1305
00:57:15,295 --> 00:57:16,420
And what do I mean by that?
我这是什么意思？

1306
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,253
Well, let me just draw some temporary lines.
好吧，让我画几条临时的线。

1307
00:57:18,253 --> 00:57:20,610
If this is how many pages are in the phone book-- dot,
如果电话簿有这么多页——点，

1308
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:24,090
dot, dot-- notice that it takes this much time, on the red line,
点，点——注意，在红线上需要这么长时间，

1309
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:25,360
to solve the problem.
才能解决这个问题。

1310
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,530
But if I, instead, use the second algorithm,
但如果我使用第二个算法，

1311
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:30,507
it takes me half as much time.
我只需要一半的时间。

1312
00:57:30,507 --> 00:57:32,340
So, even though they're both straight lines,
所以，虽然它们都是直线，

1313
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,923
one is strictly lower than the other, which means it's faster.
但其中一个严格低于另一个，这意味着它更快。

1314
00:57:34,923 --> 00:57:35,640
It's better.
它更好。

1315
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,310
But the third algorithm is a fundamentally different shape,
但第三个算法的形状从根本上来说不同，

1316
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:40,090
and it looks a little something like this.
它看起来有点像这样。

1317
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:42,370
And it looks like it's going to flatten, flatten, flatten out,
看起来它会变平，变平，一直变平，

1318
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:43,260
but it never does.
但它永远不会。

1319
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:46,170
It just rises ever so slowly.
它只是非常缓慢地上升。

1320
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:49,290
And what this means is that if maybe Cambridge and Allston, here
这意味着，如果可能的话，剑桥和奥尔斯顿，这里

1321
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:53,030
in Massachusetts, merge next year, so we go from 1,000 page phone book
在马萨诸塞州，明年合并，那么我们就从1000页的电话簿

1322
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:58,100
to a 2,000 page phone book, that means, if we're here this year,
变成了2000页的电话簿，这意味着，如果我们今年在这里，

1323
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,660
we're over here next year.
明年我们就在这里了。

1324
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,190
It's not all that much higher.
它并没有高出太多。

1325
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:04,320
But it would be much higher if we were using the first two algorithms.
但如果我们使用前两种算法，它会高很多。

1326
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:04,820
Why?
为什么？

1327
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:07,880
It'd be an extra 1,000 steps to find someone in that combined phone
这将需要多走1000步才能在合并的电话簿中找到某人

1328
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,890
book or maybe another 500 steps.
或者可能需要多走500步。

1329
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:13,520
But, to be clear, if we're using my third and final algorithm,
但明确地说，如果我们使用我的第三个也是最后一个算法，

1330
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,620
how many more steps will it take me next year,
明年我需要多走几步，

1331
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:20,930
when Cambridge and Allston merge into one 2,000-page phone book?
当剑桥和奥尔斯顿合并成一本2000页的电话簿时？

1332
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,800
Just one more step, no big deal.
只有一步，没什么大不了的。

1333
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,400
It's one more page tear.
就是撕一页。

1334
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,900
And this is what we mean, ultimately, about not just writing
这就是我们最终想要表达的意思，不只是写

1335
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:29,720
code or implementing algorithms that are correct, but, now,
代码或实现正确的算法，而是，现在，

1336
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:33,070
that are well-designed or efficient, specifically.
设计良好或高效的算法，特别是。

1337
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:35,570
And this is what makes someone a better programmer, perhaps,
这就是可能让某人成为比其他人更好的程序员的原因，

1338
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:38,237
than someone else, or a better problem-solver than someone else,
比其他人更优秀，或成为比其他人更好的问题解决者，

1339
00:58:38,237 --> 00:58:40,130
is acquiring, over time, these skills.
是随着时间的推移，习得这些技能。

1340
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:43,280
So that, sure, you could solve the problem quickly and dirtily,
因此，当然，你可以快速地、粗糙地解决问题，

1341
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,560
so to speak, but if you're going to have a lot of data
可以这么说，但如果你要处理大量的数据，

1342
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:49,492
eventually, be it in your phone book or maybe your Google website index,
最终，无论是在你的电话簿里还是你的谷歌网站索引中，

1343
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:51,200
if you're searching the web, you're going
如果你正在搜索网络，你会

1344
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,540
to want to try to think about how to design algorithms that look like this.
想要尝试思考如何设计这样的算法。

1345
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:56,370
Mathematically, this is called a logarithm.
在数学上，这被称为对数。

1346
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:59,495
And it's log base 2 because I'm halving, halving, halving, again and again.
这是以2为底的对数，因为我不断地将数据减半，减半，减半。

1347
00:58:59,495 --> 00:59:03,120
But, for now, just know that it's a fundamentally faster and different
但现在，你只需要知道，它从根本上来说更快，而且形状不同。

1348
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:03,820
shape.
形状。

1349
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:06,330
So, among our goals in CS50, ultimately, is not just
所以，在CS50中，我们的目标最终不仅仅是

1350
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:12,270
to write and solve problems correctly, but, ultimately, ever more efficiently,
正确地编写和解决问题，而是最终要更有效率，

1351
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:13,600
as well.
也是。

1352
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:20,110
Any questions, then, on these ideas of efficiency and design?
那么，关于效率和设计，你们有什么问题吗？

1353
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:21,480
Any questions here?
这里有人有疑问吗？

1354
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,080
Yeah, in back?
后面那位同学？

1355
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
观众：[听不清]

1356
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,170
DAVID J. MALAN: A good question.
大卫·J·马兰：问得好。

1357
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:27,462
Just to repeat it, can a graph like this capture the accuracy of the algorithm?
重复一遍，这样的图表可以反映出算法的准确性吗？

1358
00:59:27,462 --> 00:59:28,640
Short answer, no.
简短的回答，不行。

1359
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,460
For instance, if I drew a straight line that
例如，如果我画一条直线，

1360
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:35,570
is super low on this graph, which would imply that the algorithm takes
在这张图上非常低，这意味着算法需要

1361
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:38,240
the same amount of time, no matter how many pages there are,
相同的时间，无论有多少页，

1362
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,480
my algorithm might actually be to just pull a random page from the phone
我的算法可能是从电话簿中随机抽取一页，一步到位，然后说，就是这页。

1363
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,230
book, one step, and say, here it is.
书，一步到位，然后说，就是这页。

1364
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:45,230
But that's not necessarily going to be accurate,
但它不一定是准确的，

1365
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:47,010
unless I get really, really lucky.
除非我非常非常幸运。

1366
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:49,820
So the graph really only speaks to efficiency
所以这个图表实际上只说明了效率

1367
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:52,880
and the design of the algorithm, not the correctness of it.
以及算法的设计，而不是它的正确性。

1368
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:57,170
To analyze the correctness, you need to use another mechanism altogether,
要分析正确性，你需要使用完全不同的机制，

1369
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:58,280
namely, logic.
即逻辑。

1370
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:02,120
Other questions now, on efficiency, in this way?
现在，关于效率方面还有其他问题吗？

1371
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:02,940
No?
没有？

1372
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:03,440
All right.
好的。

1373
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,090
So, with that in mind, let's begin to translate this to some actual code.
所以，考虑到这一点，让我们开始将它翻译成一些实际的代码。

1374
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:11,630
And, in fact, before we look at, today, one actual programming language,
实际上，在我们今天查看一种实际的编程语言之前，

1375
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:14,720
albeit a graphical one, let's consider something called pseudocode.
尽管它是一个图形化的语言，让我们考虑一下一种叫做伪代码的东西。

1376
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,497
So pseudocode has no formal meaning.
所以伪代码没有正式的意义。

1377
01:00:16,497 --> 01:00:19,580
Generally, you write it in English or whatever your own human language is.
一般来说，你用英语或你自己的语言来写。

1378
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:25,600
But you write your thoughts down tersely, succinct, but precisely.
但是你要简洁、扼要、准确地写下你的想法。

1379
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,570
You try to really convey your thoughts, not with a wave of the hand,
你试图真正表达你的想法，而不是用挥手的方式，

1380
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:31,510
metaphorically, but step by step, precisely.
比喻地，而是逐步地、准确地。

1381
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:32,650
So what do I mean by this?
那么我这是什么意思呢？

1382
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:35,380
Here might be some representative pseudocode
这里可能有一些代表性的伪代码

1383
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:39,337
via which I describe that third and final algorithm in a way
通过它，我以一种方式描述了第三个也是最后一个算法

1384
01:00:39,337 --> 01:00:41,920
that I could hand it to you and you could do the same at home.
我可以把它交给你，你也可以在家里做同样的事情。

1385
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,425
Or I could hand it to someone at Google, and they could implement it in Android.
或者我可以把它交给谷歌的人，他们可以在Android上实现它。

1386
01:00:45,425 --> 01:00:48,550
Or I could hand it to someone at Apple, and they could implement it in iOS.
或者我可以把它交给苹果的人，他们可以在iOS上实现它。

1387
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:51,280
So, step one, I claimed, was "Pick up phone book."
所以，第一步，我声称是“拿起电话簿”。

1388
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,430
Step two was "Open to the middle of the phone book."
第二步是“打开电话簿的中间”。

1389
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:57,145
Step three, "Look at the page," as I did.
第三步，“看看页面”，就像我做的那样。

1390
01:00:57,145 --> 01:00:59,020
And now things get a little more interesting.
现在事情变得有点有趣了。

1391
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:03,760
Step four, "If person is on page," I have to make a decision.
第四步，“如果这个人在这页上”，我必须做出决定。

1392
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,810
Presumably, what should I do if John Harvard is on the page I'm looking at?
可以想见，如果我正在看的页面上有John Harvard，我该怎么办？

1393
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:12,050
So stop and probably make the call, or email, or whatever the goal might be.
所以停下来，可能打电话，或者发邮件，或者任何目标。

1394
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:15,430
And so I'm going to actually indent this, visually, by a few spaces,
所以我要实际地缩进这个，从视觉上来说，缩进几个空格，

1395
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:19,900
just to make clear that you should only do line five if the answer to line four
只是为了明确，只有当第四行的答案是

1396
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:21,130
is yes.
是“是”时，你才应该做第五行。

1397
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:22,360
Otherwise, you don't bother.
否则，你就别费心了。

1398
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:26,640
The next thing I'm going to do, line six, is consider another possibility.
接下来我要做的事情，第六行，是考虑另一种可能性。

1399
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,980
"If the person I'm looking for is earlier
“如果我正在寻找的人更早

1400
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,805
in the book," what do I want to do?
在书里，”我想做什么？

1401
01:01:30,805 --> 01:01:31,680
Well, I could write--
好吧，我可以写--

1402
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,388
I could describe this in a bunch of ways.
我可以以多种方式描述它。

1403
01:01:33,388 --> 01:01:35,190
I'm going to do this tersely, as follows.
我将简明扼要地做，如下所示。

1404
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:38,910
"Open to the middle of the left half of the book,
“打开书的左侧一半的中间，

1405
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:41,610
so it's open to the middle of the left half of the book.
所以它打开了书的左侧一半的中间。

1406
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:43,320
And then, what am I going to do?
然后，我要做什么？

1407
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:46,630
Well, I've just divided the problem into something smaller.
好吧，我只是把问题分解成更小的部分。

1408
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:48,580
But it's fundamentally the same problem.
但它本质上是同一个问题。

1409
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,100
It's just a fewer number of pages.
只是页数更少。

1410
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:54,017
So I'm just going to go back to line three and do it again
所以我只需要回到第三行，再做一次

1411
01:01:54,017 --> 01:01:56,850
because the problem is just getting smaller and smaller, presumably.
因为问题越来越小，可以想见。

1412
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:59,520
Else, if the person I'm looking for is later in the book,
否则，如果我正在寻找的人在书的后面，

1413
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,760
open to the middle of the right half of the book,
打开书的右侧一半的中间，

1414
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,950
and, also, "Go back to line 3."
并且，“回到第三行”。

1415
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:08,160
But there's a fourth possibility and its failure
但有一种第四种可能性，以及它的失败

1416
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,580
to realize, sometimes, that there's other possible outcomes that
有时，意识到还有其他可能的结果

1417
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:14,400
make computers crash, or spinning beach balls, or the like,
会让电脑崩溃，或者出现旋转的沙漏，或者类似的情况，

1418
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,130
if a programmer doesn't anticipate some situation.
如果程序员没有预料到某些情况。

1419
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:20,538
What's the fourth possible situation, when looking for John Harvard?
找John Harvard时，第四种可能的情况是什么？

1420
01:02:20,538 --> 01:02:22,080
AUDIENCE: If they're not in the book.
观众：如果他们不在书里。

1421
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:24,205
DAVID J. MALAN: If they're not in the book, at all.
大卫·J·马兰：如果他们根本不在书里。

1422
01:02:24,205 --> 01:02:27,450
And, indeed, I might get to the very last page and John Harvard's not even
事实上，我可能会翻到最后一页，John Harvard甚至都不

1423
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:28,200
on that one.
在那页上。

1424
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:33,450
I'd better handle that and say, else, as a catchall, just quit altogether.
我最好处理一下，并且说，否则，作为兜底，干脆退出。

1425
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:35,610
And, truly, often, in your Macs, PCs, phones,
而且，确实，通常，在你的Mac、PC、手机中，

1426
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:38,310
when they freeze, or, again, spinning beach ball, or the like,
当它们冻结时，或者，再次出现旋转的沙漏，或者类似情况，

1427
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:39,660
and just weird things happen, that's just
以及奇怪的事情发生，那只是

1428
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:41,220
because some human made a dumb mistake.
因为有人犯了一个愚蠢的错误。

1429
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:44,430
And they didn't realize that you could somehow get your phone or your laptop
他们没有意识到，你可能会以某种方式让你的手机或笔记本电脑

1430
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:47,070
into a configuration that they didn't anticipate.
进入他们没有预料到的配置。

1431
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:48,870
So we're going to try to handle that here.
所以我们要在这里尝试处理一下。

1432
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:50,880
Now this is just one way of writing pseudocode.
现在这只是写伪代码的一种方式。

1433
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,230
There's no one way to do this.
没有一种唯一的方法。

1434
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:55,500
All of us in this room could come up with slightly different pseudocode.
我们房间里的每个人都可以想出稍微不同的伪代码。

1435
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:59,190
But I think you'll find characteristic are certain building
但我认为你会发现，特征是一些特定的构建

1436
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:02,130
blocks in all of our answers.
块，在我们的所有答案中。

1437
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:04,590
Here, in yellow, are what, as of today, we're
这里，用黄色，是那些，从今天开始，我们将

1438
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:07,540
going to start calling "functions," technically speaking.
开始称之为“函数”，从技术上来说。

1439
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:10,800
These are like actions or verbs that literally, in this case, tell me
这些就像动作或动词，在这种情况中，它们实际上告诉我

1440
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:11,700
what to do.
该做什么。

1441
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:15,150
Next, we're going to have these things, conditionals,
接下来，我们将有这些东西，条件，

1442
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:20,525
forks in the road, so to speak, that take me down this path or another,
道路的分岔路口，这么说吧，它们带我走这条路或另一条路，

1443
01:03:20,525 --> 01:03:21,150
metaphorically.
比喻地。

1444
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:22,933
So I do this thing or something else.
所以我做这件事或者其他事情。

1445
01:03:22,933 --> 01:03:25,350
But how do I decide if I want to go this way, or this way,
但我如何决定我想走这条路，还是那条路，

1446
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:26,620
or this way, or this way?
还是这条路，还是那条路？

1447
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:27,780
I need to ask a question.
我需要问一个问题。

1448
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:30,000
And in programming, we'll typically use what
在编程中，我们通常会使用

1449
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,240
are called Boolean expressions, named after a mathematician, Boole.
叫做布尔表达式，以数学家布尔命名。

1450
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:36,090
And a Boolean expression is essentially just a question
布尔表达式本质上只是一个问题

1451
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:42,300
with a yes/no answer, a true or false answer, a 1 or 0 answer.
有一个是/否的答案，一个真或假的答案，一个1或0的答案。

1452
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:45,520
It doesn't matter how you think about it, but it's got two possible answers.
无论你如何思考它，但它都有两种可能的答案。

1453
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:49,228
And so you can think of these as being expressions with question marks,
所以你可以把这些想象成带有问号的表达式，

1454
01:03:49,228 --> 01:03:50,520
even though I didn't draw such.
尽管我没有画出来。

1455
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,270
Person on page, person earlier in book, person later in book,
人在这页上，人更早地在书里，人更晚地在书里，

1456
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:55,590
those are Boolean expressions.
这些都是布尔表达式。

1457
01:03:55,590 --> 01:04:00,400
And they tell me whether I should go down one fork in the road or another.
它们告诉我我应该走一条分岔路还是另一条。

1458
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,600
And, lastly, there's this, "Go back to line 3," in two different places.
最后，这里还有“返回到第 3 行”这句话，出现在两个不同的位置。

1459
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,630
That represents what we call a "loop," some kind of cycle that's
这代表我们所说的“循环”，某种反复执行的周期。

1460
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:08,370
doing something again and again.
一遍又一遍地做着某件事。

1461
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:10,733
Now these are just a few building blocks here--
现在，这里只是一些基本的构建块——

1462
01:04:10,733 --> 01:04:12,900
functions, conditionals, Boolean expressions, loops.
函数、条件语句、布尔表达式和循环。

1463
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:15,210
But you'll find that they're characteristic of so
但你会发现，它们是如此之多的不同语言的特征，其中一种我们今天将要学习，另一种我们将在下周学习。

1464
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:18,380
many different languages, one of which we'll look at today, another of which
许多不同的语言，其中一种我们今天将要学习，另一种我们将在下周学习。

1465
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:19,380
we'll look at next week.
我们将在下周学习。

1466
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:23,130
And those include, indeed, C, and Python, and other languages still.
它们包括 C、Python，以及其他一些语言。

1467
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:25,350
And so this is why we focus on these basics
所以这就是为什么我们在这最初的几天里专注于这些基础知识

1468
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:27,480
and fundamentals in these early days because we're
和基本原理，因为我们将会

1469
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,080
going to see them again and again.
反复看到它们。

1470
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,800
So even if you feel like that fire hose is hitting you sometime,
所以即使你感觉像水管喷射了你，

1471
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,320
we'll give you, today, ultimately, more visuals
我们今天将最终为您提供更多视觉辅助

1472
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:38,730
by which you can hang onto, so as to actually write code, ultimately,
以便您能抓住它们，最终实际编写代码，

1473
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:41,490
in different languages and solve all sorts of problems.
用不同的语言解决各种各样的问题。

1474
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:46,050
Now, we'd be remiss in not bringing up what's behind characters like Spot,
现在，如果我们不提及像 Spot 这样的角色背后的东西，我们会很疏忽，

1475
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:48,570
and ChatGPT, and other software, artificial intelligence.
还有 ChatGPT 以及其他软件，人工智能。

1476
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:51,430
And it turns out, to get to the point of AI,
事实证明，要达到人工智能的水平，

1477
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:54,150
we're actually going to need more building blocks than just
我们实际上需要的不仅仅是函数、循环和条件语句。

1478
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:56,125
functions, and loops, and conditionals.
函数、循环和条件语句。

1479
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:57,750
It's not going to be quite that simple.
这不会那么简单。

1480
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:59,200
But this has been a lot, so far.
但到目前为止，这已经很多了。

1481
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,530
Let's go ahead, here, and take a five-minute break.
让我们在这里休息五分钟。

1482
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:03,990
And when we resume, we'll take a look not only at AI,
当我们继续时，我们将不仅看一看人工智能，

1483
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:06,630
but also a specific language called Scratch.
而且还将看一看一种名为 Scratch 的特定语言。

1484
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:09,870
So no cake, just yet, but we'll come back in five.
所以还没有蛋糕，但我们将在五分钟后回来。

1485
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:14,820
Before we dive back in, I just wanted to call out a special guest
在我们重新开始之前，我只想提一下一位特别的客人

1486
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:16,980
that we have here today, beyond Spot, someone

who's come from even farther away.
他们来自更远的地方。

事实上，如果你们中的任何人学习过 CS50x，也就是公开课版本

1489
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:25,270

1517
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:50,500
inspired some of those headlines with which we began
引发了一些我们开课时提到的那些标题，

1518
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,780
class, that weren't quite on the nose.

1519
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:54,880
So the class will still be taught by us humans,

1520
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:59,170
but helped by this CS50 duck, a chatbot of sorts.

1526
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,960
But I think we can skate in that direction, intellectually.

1527
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:19,670
So, for instance, if we were to take a stab at implementing our own chatbot--

1528
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:22,883
some interactive text-based program that talks to us,

1536
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:41,840
then the chatbot should say, hello, back.
那么聊天机器人应该说“你好”作为回应。

1537
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,900
Else, if the student says, goodbye, well, the chatbot

asking more interesting questions, like, else,
问一些更有意思的问题时，比如，否则，

1542
01:07:57,470 --> 01:08:00,990
if the student asks why 111 in binary is 7 in decimal.
如果学生问为什么二进制的 111 等于十进制的 7。

1543
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:03,980
Now, you could imagine that we just have a conditional,
现在，你可以想象我们只有一个条件语句，

1544
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:08,570
with this Boolean expression, that programs the chatbot to just give you
加上这个布尔表达式，将聊天机器人编程为直接给你

1545

the answer and explain, in an English sentence, why that, in fact, is.
答案，并用一句英语解释为什么实际上是这样。

1546

但如果你是学生，你问为什么 110 等于十进制的 6 或者为什么 010 等于 2 呢？

1547
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:24,229
I mean, you can just imagine the explosion in the amount of code
我的意思是，你可以想象我们必须编写的代码量会爆炸，

1548
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:28,370
that we would have to write to just anticipate every darn question that you
我们必须编写这些代码来预测你可能问的每一个问题，

1549
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:31,375
might ask about today and every other class, not to mention all

1551
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:36,649
So, surely, there are other ways to implement algorithms

1553
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:43,700
more generally, to be fed input, still, like all of the internet, all
更一般地说，可以持续输入信息，就像整个互联网一样，所有

1556
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:54,330
on those kinds of inputs, assuming the inputs, themselves, are accurate.
假设这些输入本身是准确的。

1557
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:56,510
So "large language models" is a term you might
所以，你可能听说过“大型语言模型”，

1558
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:59,720
have heard bandied about over the past several months, or LLMs.
或者叫做LLMs，在过去几个月里经常被提及。

1559

01:09:04,729 --> 01:09:09,630
of code that actually takes, as input, lots and lots of language--

1561
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:13,310
like the text of lots and lots of web pages, dictionaries, encyclopedias,

1563
01:09:14,779 --> 01:09:19,729
and infers, from the patterns of English words or any human language,

what a typical human might actually say when asked a question.
一个普通人被问到问题时可能会说什么。

1565
01:09:22,907 --> 01:09:24,740
And some of these questions are easy, right?
其中一些问题很简单，对吧？

1566
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:28,165
Probably, on the internet, alone, not to mention everyday life, if someone

1567
01:09:28,165 --> 01:09:29,540
extends their hand and says, "Hi.
伸出手说，“你好。

1568

1572
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:37,250
So I bet we could write software that just
所以我敢说我们可以编写软件，它只需

1573
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:41,569
infers what it should say, probabilistically, statistically, based

1576
01:09:45,442 --> 01:09:47,359
to go, when it comes to the most sophisticated

1577
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:49,151
of algorithms, where you and I, the humans,

01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:51,979
we don't try to anticipate every possible input.

1579
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:54,620
Rather, we give it a more general purpose

1580
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:58,277
input, like all human knowledge, and ideally just let it figure things out.
输入，就像所有的人类知识一样，理想情况下，只是让它自己想办法解决。

1581
01:09:58,277 --> 01:09:59,610
Now, we're not quite there, yet.
现在，我们还没有完全达到那个阶段。

1582
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:02,000
And odds are you've heard of hallucinations or just mistakes

1585
01:10:05,005 --> 01:10:07,130
And sometimes there's a bit of randomness sprinkled
有时会添加一些随机性，

1586
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:10,088
in because you don't want the thing to always say the exact same thing.
因为你不希望它总是说同样的话。

1587
01:10:10,088 --> 01:10:14,250
Even you and I might say, "Eh, I'm not that great today" 10% of the time.
即使你我，也可能在 10% 的时间里说，“哎，我今天状态不太好”。

1588
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,730
So you need to perturb the output in some way.
所以你需要以某种方式扰乱输出。

1589
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:20,630
But within CS50 and within this world of large language models,
但在 CS50 和大型语言模型的世界里，

1590
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:24,630
we do have these tools like ChatGPT, and Bing, chat, and others.
我们确实拥有 ChatGPT、Bing 聊天等工具。

1591
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:26,810
And we'll stipulate that, for CS50's purposes,

1592
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:28,910
the direction we're going this year is that this

1593
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:30,710
is what's in the syllabus, dot, dot, dot;
是课程大纲中规定的，点，点，点；

1594
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:32,840
that it will not be allowed, it will be considered
不允许使用，会被认为是

1595
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:37,348
not reasonable to use AI-based software, other than CS50's own.
不合理的行为，除了使用 CS50 自身开发的软件以外。

1596
01:10:37,348 --> 01:10:39,140
So the goal here is not to simply take away

1599
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:48,440
But we'd like there to be some guardrails, intellectually, on just how
但是，我们希望在智力方面有一些限制，来规范这些聊天机器人到底有多

1600
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,653
helpful these chatbots are.
有用。

1601
01:10:49,653 --> 01:10:52,070
Because as you've probably seen, if you ask it a question,
因为你可能已经看到，如果你问它一个问题，

1602
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:54,560
these chatbots are already pretty good at not just helping
这些聊天机器人已经做得相当不错了，它们不仅仅是帮助

1603
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,310
you finish your current thought, but it'll

hand you your second and your third thought and do the assignment for you.
帮你完成第二个、第三个想法，并替你完成作业。

1605
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:02,660
But I think, through prompting, so to speak,
但我认为，通过提示，可以说，

1606
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:04,850
we'll be able to coax some of our own tools,

being computer scientists, ourself, in a direction

1608
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:10,200
that you actually find to be the right balance, akin to having

1609
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:14,310
a good tutor by your side 24/7, who doesn't just hand you answers,
24/7 在你身边的好导师，他不会直接给你答案，

1610
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:16,223
but, indeed, tries to lead you to the same.
而是试图引导你找到答案。

1611
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:18,390
So you actually get something out of the experience,
所以你真的从这段经历中获得了东西，

1612
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:20,520
and, ideally, three-plus months from now,

1613
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,380
those training wheels can come off, too.

And you're able to still stand on your own.

1615
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,770
So it will be reasonable to use CS50's own AI-based software which
所以，使用 CS50 自身开发的基于人工智能的软件是合理的，它

1616
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:33,210
will actually take the form of a CS50 duck, which is actually available now--
实际上会以 CS50 小黄鸭的形式出现，现在就可以使用——

1617
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:37,170
and we'll use it throughout the term-- at CS50.ai, a web-based application
我们将在整个学期使用它——在 CS50.ai，一个基于网络的应用程序

1618
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:39,450
that's quite similar to ChatGPT, but that

has the personality of a CS50 teaching fellow or TF, or teaching assistant,

TA，它也恰好把自己当作一只小黄鸭。

1621
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:49,860
And for reasons we'll get to in a couple of weeks time,
至于原因，我们将在几周后讲到，

1622
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:54,105
but rubber ducks, in particular, are a thing in programming.
但橡胶鸭子，尤其是在编程领域，是不可或缺的一部分。

1623
01:11:54,105 --> 01:11:56,730

不过，我们很快就会讲到，你甚至可以从我桌子上的那只

1624
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:58,350
there on my desk.
看到。

1625
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:01,110
With that said, too, well, I'm going to call out CS50's own Brenda

1628
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:11,560
most recently, once it actually did more than quack a random number

01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,540
of times in response to questions, has now

already, with some of your predecessors, through the Harvard Summer School.
已经，通过哈佛暑期课程，让一些你的前辈使用过它。

I love how AI bots will answer questions without ego and without judgment

without treating them like they're stupid.

It has, as one could expect, an inhuman level of patience."

as there are in CS50--

And I think you'll find, too, that we're on the cusp of something

1650
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:11,080
pretty remarkable, in the coming years, where

not only within the confines of a class, but on your own, ultimately, as well.
不仅局限于课堂，最终也可以自己学习。

1653
01:13:18,110 --> 01:13:22,270
And as one other student put it, at summer's end, with respect to the duck,

And we started today by talking about binary.

And darn it, here it is again.
可恶，它又出现了。

until we understand this.

1663
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:43,090
does.

I just happen to know that they are the same.

this is not something that a computer scientist or programmer worries about.
这不是计算机科学家或程序员需要担心的事情。

the hardware inside of the computers.

start writing at a keyboard.

years ago, when taking CS50, when all we learned at the time was C.
多年前，当学习 CS50 时，当时我们只学习了 C。

But this, too, has some crypticness to it.
但这也有一些神秘之处。

01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:11,020
And if you've never programmed before, you can probably wrap your mind around,
如果你以前从未编程过，你可能可以理解，

1698
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:14,190
OK, I'm guessing the "printf" prints out the "hello, world."
好吧，我猜“printf”会打印出“你好，世界”。

1704
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:31,500
And so, today, what we'll do is focus not

1705
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:35,100
on syntax, characters on the keyboard, but ideas

because what really matters in this program

as early as like middle school or the like.

interactive art, or the like.

01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:30,600
But we'll use it today for just a bit.
但我们今天只会用它一小会儿。

1727
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,670
And we'll use it in the course's first homework,
我们将在本课程的第一个作业中使用它，

1728
01:16:32,670 --> 01:16:36,870
AKA problem set 0, to explore now some of these same ideas.
也就是问题集 0，现在探索一些相同的概念。

1729
01:16:36,870 --> 01:16:39,720
And among the goals today for the remainder of today
而今天余下时间的目标之一

1730
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,920
is not to focus so much on Scratch and the particulars
并不是太关注 Scratch 和细节

1731
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,670
because this is not a language that you're
因为这不是你会经常使用的语言，而是为了

1732
01:16:44,670 --> 01:16:50,280
going to use often but to give you very visual representations of ideas
给你非常直观的概念表现形式。

1733
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:53,790
so that when things do escalate next week to C, to the more cryptic,
这样，当事情在下周升级到C，也就是更隐秘的时候，

1734
01:16:53,790 --> 01:16:57,840
it's the same ideas just typed out instead of dragged and dropped.
使用的还是相同的思路，只是用打字代替了拖放。

1735
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,460
So by that, I mean this.
我的意思是这个。

1736
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:03,270
I'm going to go ahead and share in just a moment the user interface of Scratch.
我将在片刻后分享Scratch的用户界面。

1737
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:05,370
But what's nice about Scratch is that this
但是Scratch的好处在于，这个

1738
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:08,400
is how we're going to implement that same program today.
就是我们今天将要实现相同程序的方式。

1739
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,200
These are two blocks or puzzle pieces on the screen,
屏幕上这两个是块或拼图碎片，

1740
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:15,670
and they've been interconnected to tell the computer to say "hello, world"
它们相互连接，告诉计算机说“你好，世界”。

1741
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:16,570
on the screen.

1742
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:18,490
The user interface that we're about to use

1743
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:20,652
will look generally something like this.
大体上会像这样。

1744
01:17:20,652 --> 01:17:22,360
It's a web-based editor that you can also

01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:24,160
download it locally to use offline.
将其下载到本地以离线使用。

1746
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:28,120
And you'll see that at the left here are a whole bunch of puzzle pieces
你会看到左边这里有一堆拼图碎片

1747
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:29,020
or blocks.
或块。

1748
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:31,630
They're categorized by color, and the blue ones
它们按颜色分类，蓝色的一般

1749
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:33,980
tend to relate to motion, for instance.
与运动有关，比如。

1750
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:35,950
The purple ones represent looks.
紫色的一般代表外观。

01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:40,180
The yellow one represents events.
黄色的一般代表事件。

1753
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:41,230
More on that soon.
稍后会详细介绍。

1754
01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:43,270
The orange ones represent control, and then
橙色的一般代表控制，然后

1755
01:17:43,270 --> 01:17:46,390
there's operators, variables, my blocks, and even some extensions
还有运算符、变量、我的块，甚至一些扩展

1756
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:47,690
we can install as well.
也可以安装。

1757
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:51,820
So it just categorizes things visually and colorfully so that you
所以它只是以视觉和多彩的方式对事物进行分类，以便你

1758
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:53,470
can find what you're looking for.
可以找到你想要的东西。

1759
01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:56,740
But we're going to use these puzzle pieces to drag and drop them
但我们将使用这些拼图碎片并将它们拖放到

1760
01:17:56,740 --> 01:17:58,300
onto this area here.
这个区域。

1761
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:02,030
And we're going to connect them when we want them to do something.
当我们想让它们做某事时，我们将把它们连接起来。

1762
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:02,890
What can they do?
它们能做什么呢？

1763
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:06,010
Well, by default, Scratch comes with this cat here, otherwise known
默认情况下，Scratch 这里有一个猫，也被称为

1764
01:18:06,010 --> 01:18:09,760
as a sprite, which is a character in a game or in a graphics context.
精灵，它是游戏中或图形环境中的一个角色。

1765
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,310
And this cat lives in this two-dimensional world in which
这只猫生活在这个二维世界中，

1766
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:14,050
the cat can go up, down, left, right.
猫可以上下左右移动。

1767
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:16,330
And you can actually change the cat's costume

1768
01:18:16,330 --> 01:18:18,730
to be a dog, a bird, or anything else.
成为狗、鸟或任何其他东西。

1769
01:18:18,730 --> 01:18:23,260
It really is more of an idea than it is a specific animal in this case.
实际上，它更像是一种概念，而不是具体动物。

1770
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:26,950
But the world that Scratch lives in looks a little something like this.
但 Scratch 所处的世界看起来有点像这样。

1771
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:29,860
It's like a Cartesian plane with x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
它就像一个笛卡尔坐标系，具有 x 坐标和 y 坐标。

1772
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:32,050
And the numbers don't so much matter fundamentally,
从根本上说，数字并不那么重要，

1773
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:35,390
except that when you want the cat or any character to go up,
除非你想让猫或任何角色向上移动，

1774
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:37,300
down, left, or right by some amount, it's
向下、向左或向右移动一定距离，

1775
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:42,985
useful to know, for instance, that 0, 0 is the middle, 0 comma 0 for x comma y.
知道这一点很有用，例如，0, 0 是中间，0 逗号 0 代表 x 逗号 y。

1776
01:18:42,985 --> 01:18:45,550
All the way up is a y value of 180.
最上面是 y 值为 180。

1777
01:18:45,550 --> 01:18:47,470
All the way down is -180.
最下面是 -180。

1778
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:50,170
All the way to the left is -240.
最左边是 -240。

1779
01:18:50,170 --> 01:18:52,030
All the way to the right is 240.
最右边是 240。

1780
01:18:52,030 --> 01:18:54,655
And generally, you're not going to have to worry about numbers.
通常，你不用担心数字。

1781
01:18:54,655 --> 01:18:58,030
You're going to use these relatively-- go right, go left, go up, or down.
你会相对地使用这些——向右、向左、向上或向下。

1782
01:18:58,030 --> 01:19:01,970
But that's just the world that Scratch itself lives in here.
但这只是 Scratch 本身所处的世界。

1783
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:03,730
So let's go about using Scratch here.
所以让我们开始使用 Scratch。

1784
01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:06,880
I'm going to change over to my cloud-based editor
我将切换到我的云端编辑器

1785
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:10,120
here, where I've gone to scratch.mit.edu.
这里，我已经访问了 scratch.mit.edu。

1786
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,520
And I've clicked Create in order to create a project.
我点击了“创建”来创建一个项目。

1787
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,822
And that gives me this blank canvas here.
这给了我这个空白画布。

1788
01:19:14,822 --> 01:19:17,530
And I'm going to do these somewhat quickly because I kind of know
我将快速完成这些步骤，因为我多少知道

1789
01:19:17,530 --> 01:19:18,440
what I'm looking for.
我要找什么。

1790
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:21,400
But part of the process with problem set zero is going to be clicking,
但问题集 0 的一部分将是点击，

1791
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,410
and dragging, and sort of scrolling around
拖动，以及四处滚动

1792
01:19:23,410 --> 01:19:25,390
to see what building blocks exist.
看看有哪些构建块。

1793
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:29,020
But I know under Events there's this puzzle piece here
但我清楚在事件下有这个拼图碎片

1794
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:30,910
when green flag clicked.
当绿色旗帜被点击时。

1795
01:19:30,910 --> 01:19:32,110
Why is that germane?
为什么这很重要？

1796
01:19:32,110 --> 01:19:35,720
Well, if I zoom out, and go back to Scratch's world at the right here,
如果我放大，并回到右侧的 Scratch 世界，

1797
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:37,720
notice that above Scratch's world there's
注意在 Scratch 世界的上面有一个

1798
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:40,870
a green flag, which is going to mean go, and a red stop sign, which,
绿色旗帜，表示开始，红色停止标志，当然，表示停止。

1799
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:42,290
of course, is going to mean stop.
当然，表示停止。

1800
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:46,780
So if I drag this puzzle piece anywhere into the middle,
所以，如果我把这个拼图碎片拖到中间的任何地方，

1801
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:49,180
it's just going to plop where I put it.
它就会落在我的放置位置。

1802
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:53,380
But what that means semantically is when someone clicks that green flag,
但从语义上来说，这意味着当有人点击绿色旗帜时，

1803
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:56,440
I want Scratch the cat to do this other thing.
我希望 Scratch 猫做另一件事。

1804
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:57,970
Well, what do I want it to do?
嗯，我想要它做什么呢？

1805
01:19:57,970 --> 01:19:59,560
Well, let me go under Looks.
让我看看外观。

1806
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:04,090
And looks here in purple have some puzzle pieces like this.
外观里有一些像这样的紫色拼图碎片。

1807
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:06,490
Well, I can say hello for some number of seconds,
我可以说几秒钟的“你好”，

1808
01:20:06,490 --> 01:20:08,620
or I can just go ahead and say hello.
或者直接说“你好”。

1809
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:09,430
So let's do that.
那就这样吧。

1810
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:11,650
I'm going to drag this say block.
我要拖动这个“说”块。

1811
01:20:11,650 --> 01:20:13,630
And notice that as soon as I get close enough,
注意，当我靠近它时，

1812
01:20:13,630 --> 01:20:15,562
it's going to magnetically want to connect.
它就会像磁铁一样想要连接。

1813
01:20:15,562 --> 01:20:17,770
So I can let go, and they snap together automatically
所以我可以松开手，它们会自动连接在一起

1814
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:19,103
because they're the right shape.
因为它们的形状是匹配的。

1815
01:20:19,103 --> 01:20:21,100
I don't have to say hello, exclamation point.
我不必说“你好”，感叹号。

1816
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:23,920
I can change it to the more canonical, hello comma world.
我可以把它改成更规范的，你好，世界。

1817
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:26,440
So anything in this white oval is editable
所以，这个白色椭圆中的任何内容都可以编辑

1818
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:28,870
that you can change as just text there.
你可以在这里将其更改为文本。

1819
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:31,960
If I now zoom out, let me go ahead and click the green flag.
现在，如果我放大，让我点击绿色旗帜。

1820
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:36,556
And voila-- this should be my first program in Scratch.
瞧，这应该是我的第一个 Scratch 程序。

1821
01:20:36,556 --> 01:20:37,430
Hello, world.
你好，世界。

1822
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:39,410
Without any of the distractions of syntax
没有语法带来的干扰

1823
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:42,420
or weird characters on the screen, it's just done what I want it to do.
或屏幕上奇怪的字符，它只是做了我想要它做的事情。

1824
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:42,920
All right.
好的。

1825
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,462
Let me go ahead and click Stop there.
让我点击停止。

1826
01:20:44,462 --> 01:20:47,240
And let me make it a little more connected
让我把它与我们迄今为止讨论的内容联系得更紧密一些。

1827
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,750
to what we've discussed thus far.
与我们迄今为止讨论的内容联系得更紧密一些。

1828
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:51,380
So this puzzle piece here, say hello, world,
所以这个拼图碎片，说“你好，世界”，

1829
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:56,370
represents what type of building block using the vocabulary of today?
使用今天的词汇，它代表哪种类型的构建块？

1830
01:20:56,370 --> 01:20:57,420
So it's a function.
所以这是一个函数。

1831
01:20:57,420 --> 01:21:00,048
So these purple blocks are functions, say, hello, world.
所以这些紫色块是函数，比如“hello, world”。

1832
01:21:00,048 --> 01:21:02,090
And let me give you another piece of terminology.
让我再给你介绍另一个术语。

1833
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:04,910
These white ovals that take textual input--
这些白色椭圆形，接受文本输入——

1834
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:08,210
in general, those are called parameters or arguments.
一般来说，这些被称为参数或实参。

1835
01:21:08,210 --> 01:21:11,610
And they customize the behavior of a function.
它们会定制函数的行为。

1836
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:14,180
So a parameter or an argument customizes,
所以参数或实参会定制，

1837
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:17,810
modifies the default behavior of a function, like in this case, say.
修改函数的默认行为，就像这种情况下的“say”。

1838
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:20,990
Similarly, in the C code from earlier that we'll see next week,
类似地，在我们下周看到的早期 C 代码中，

1839
01:21:20,990 --> 01:21:27,350
the printf function took a quoted phrase like, hello, world, similarly as input.
printf 函数接受像“hello, world”这样的带引号的短语作为输入。

1840
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:29,970
But more on that in the future.
但这将在未来详细介绍。

1841
01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:32,810
So how does this connect to the mental model we presented earlier?
那么，这如何与我们之前提出的心理模型联系起来？

1842
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:37,140
Well, here's problem-solving as I described it earlier, inputs to outputs
那么，就像我之前描述的那样，这就是解决问题的方式，输入到输出

1843
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:39,090
with algorithms or code in the middle.
中间是算法或代码。

1844
01:21:39,090 --> 01:21:43,710
Well, what we've got here really is an input of, hello, world, the white oval.
实际上，我们这里有一个输入，即“hello, world”，白色的椭圆形。

1845
01:21:43,710 --> 01:21:48,600
The function or algorithm that it's going into as input is the say block.
作为输入的函数或算法是“say”块。

1846
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:51,960
And what is the output of using this say block, the say function?
那么，使用“say”块（“say”函数）的输出是什么？

1847
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:55,650
It's the visual effect of having the cat have the little speech bubble appear
就是让猫的头上出现一个小气泡的视觉效果

1848
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:58,060
above its head, saying, hello, world.
上面写着“hello, world”。

1849
01:21:58,060 --> 01:22:00,900
So everything we do, in fact, can be mapped back
所以我们所做的一切，实际上都可以映射回

1850
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:04,590
to that very simple idea of inputs and outputs.
那个非常简单的输入和输出的概念。

1851
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:06,840
Well, let's make it a little more interesting, though.
不过，让我们让它更有趣一些。

1852
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:09,430
It's a little boring to just say "hello, world" all the time.
一直说“hello, world”有点无聊。

1853
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:11,500
Let me go ahead and drag this away.
让我把它拖走。

1854
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:15,180
And if you just drag it to the left and let go, it gets automatically deleted.
如果你把它拖到左边然后松开，它就会自动删除。

1855
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:18,580
Let me go under Sensing in light blue here.
让我到“Sensing”（感知）模块里，它是浅蓝色的。

1856
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:20,850
And you'll see there's a bunch of blocks, one of which
你会看到有很多块，其中一块

1857
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:24,180
is an ask block, an ask function, which is going to prompt
是一个“ask”（询问）块，一个“ask”函数，它将提示

1858
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:26,170
the human, me, for some input.
人类，也就是我，输入一些东西。

1859
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:29,700
So let me go ahead and drag that over here, and it snaps together.
所以让我把它拖到这里，它会自动对齐。

1860
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:32,190
I could change the question, but I'm OK with that question.
我可以改变问题，但我对这个问题感到满意。

1861
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:33,670
We'll use what's your name.
我们将使用“what's your name”。

1862
01:22:33,670 --> 01:22:36,900
But notice that this block, ask, is a little special.
但请注意，这个“ask”块有点特殊。

1863
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:40,240
It is not just going to display like a speech bubble on the screen.
它不仅仅是在屏幕上显示像气泡一样的文字。

1864
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:42,510
It's actually going to return a value, and this is
它实际上会返回一个值，而这就是

1865
01:22:42,510 --> 01:22:44,250
another term of art today and onward.
从今天开始，另一个专业术语。

1866
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:48,492
A return value is some value that can be handed back to you conceptually
返回值是一个可以从概念上返回给你的值

1867
01:22:48,492 --> 01:22:50,700
from a function so that you can do something with it.
来自函数，以便你可以对其进行操作。

1868
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:55,025
It's as though the ask function asks someone for their name,
就像“ask”函数询问某人的姓名一样，

1869
01:22:55,025 --> 01:22:57,900
writes it down on a piece of paper, and hands you the piece of paper.
把它写在一张纸上，然后把这张纸给你。

1870
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:00,150
You can do anything now that you want with that name.
现在你可以用这个名字做任何你想做的事。

1871
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:03,810
And here is how you access the name in this special block called
而你访问这个名字的方法是在这个特殊的块中，叫做

1872
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:07,330
answer, which, again, will start calling a return value.
“answer”，它又开始被称为返回值。

1873
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:10,770
So if I want to say "hello" to someone specific, I'm going to do this.
所以，如果我想对某个人说“hello”，我会这样做。

1874
01:23:10,770 --> 01:23:11,800
Let me zoom out.
让我缩小一下。

1875
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:15,510
Let me go back to Looks, and let me go back to Say.
让我回到“Looks”（外观）模块，再回到“Say”。

1876
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:19,890
And I'm going to change the say block here to "hello, comma."
我将把这里的“say”块改成“hello, ”。

1877
01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:21,270
Then I'm going to zoom out.
然后我再缩小一下。

1878
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:23,700
Well, I need two inputs, I think.
我认为，我需要两个输入。

1879
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:26,640
So I'm going to grab another say block, and I'm going to put it below.
所以我会再拿一个“say”块，把它放在下面。

1880
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:29,160
And I could just type "David," but this is
我可以直接输入“David”，但这会

1881
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:31,660
going to defeat the whole point of asking me for the name.
破坏询问我名字的整个目的。

1882
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:32,610
And it will only work for me.
而且它只对我有用。

1883
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:33,790
So I don't want to do that.
所以我不想这样做。

1884
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:38,520
So let me go back to Sensing, and notice the shape is important here.
所以我回到“Sensing”，注意这里的形状很重要。

1885
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:41,130
Even if it's not quite the same size, the shape matters.
即使它的大小不太一样，形状也很重要。

1886
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:45,690
And I can actually drag this and change the input of this say function
我实际上可以把它拖动，并改变这个“say”函数的输入

1887
01:23:45,690 --> 01:23:48,870
to be whatever that return value is, that piece of paper
成为那个返回值，那张纸

1888
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:50,430
that has the person's name on it.
上面写着那个人的名字。

1889
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:53,550
And it grows to fill, but now we have a program
它会自动调整大小，但现在我们有一个程序

1890
01:23:53,550 --> 01:23:57,240
that I think when I click the green flag-- watch-- is going to prompt me.
我认为当我点击绿色的旗子时——看着——它会提示我。

1891
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,367
What's your name?
你的名字是什么？

1892
01:23:58,367 --> 01:23:59,950
And now I have room to type down here.
现在我可以在这里输入了。

1893
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:02,370
So I'm going to type D-A-V-I-D. I'm going to hit Enter,
所以我将输入 D-A-V-I-D，然后按回车键，

1894
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:04,000
and it should say "hello, Dave."
它应该显示“hello, Dave”。

1895
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:04,500
Wait.
等等。

1896
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:06,110
Hmm.
嗯。

1897
01:24:06,110 --> 01:24:07,050
Huh.
嗯。

1898
01:24:07,050 --> 01:24:09,990
Maybe it was-- didn't work.
也许它——没用。

1899
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:11,160
D-A-V-I-D. Here we go.
D-A-V-I-D。开始了。

1900
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:12,165
Hello, David.
Hello, David。

1901
01:24:12,165 --> 01:24:13,530
Hmm.
嗯。

1902
01:24:13,530 --> 01:24:19,210
It's missing the hello, but I'm quite sure we have a hello right there.
它没有显示“hello”，但我相当确定我们那里有一个“hello”。

1903
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:22,170
So what explains this bug or mistake?
所以，是什么解释了这个 bug 或错误？

1904
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:23,117
Yeah.
是啊。

1905
01:24:23,117 --> 01:24:26,596
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
观众： [听不清]

1906
01:24:26,596 --> 01:24:29,090
So they overlap.
所以它们重叠了。

1907
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:30,800
DAVID J. MALAN: Exactly.
大卫·马兰：没错。

1908
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,710
Put another way, my Mac, my PC, it's just so darn
换句话说，我的 Mac，我的 PC，它就是太快了

1909
01:24:33,710 --> 01:24:36,320
fast that it did exactly what it was supposed to.
以至于它准确地执行了它应该做的事情。

1910
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:40,580
But it said "hello, David" so fast that we didn't even see, we being the human,
但它说“hello, David”太快了，以至于我们，作为人类，

1911
01:24:40,580 --> 01:24:42,795
the slowest part of the puzzle, see the actual hello.
这个拼图中最慢的部分，没有看到真正的“hello”。

1912
01:24:42,795 --> 01:24:45,170
So there's a few different ways to fix this, as you know.
所以，正如你所知，有很多不同的方法可以修复它。

1913
01:24:45,170 --> 01:24:48,660
We could have it say "hello" for some number of seconds.
我们可以让它显示“hello”几秒钟。

1914
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:49,910
So I could kind of do that.
所以我可以这样做。

1915
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:50,660
So let me do this.
所以让我这样做。

1916
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:53,210
I can decouple these by just dragging and letting it go
我可以通过拖动然后松开，来分离它们

1917
01:24:53,210 --> 01:24:55,220
so that they're magnetically far apart.
这样它们就会被磁性地隔开。

1918
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:58,610
Let me go ahead and drag this one, say hello for two seconds.
让我拖动这个，让它显示“hello”两秒钟。

1919
01:24:58,610 --> 01:25:02,030
I'm going to change the grammar here to be hello comma again.
我要把这里的语法改回“hello, ”。

1920
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:05,120
I'm going to go ahead and disconnect these two.
我将分离这两个。

1921
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:08,160
I'm going to throw away the old one that I don't want to use.
我将丢弃那个我不想要使用的旧块。

1922
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:11,460
And I'm going to reconnect this so that now--
我将重新连接它，这样现在——

1923
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:11,960
OK.
好的。

1924
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:14,960
It's going to say hello for two seconds and then my name, hopefully.
它将显示“hello”两秒钟，然后是我的名字，希望如此。

1925
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:17,180
So let me click Stop and Start.
所以让我点击“停止”和“开始”。

1926
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:20,970
D-A-V-I-D. Enter.
D-A-V-I-D。按下回车键。

1927
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:21,540
OK.
好的。

1928
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:25,577
So it's better, but it's kind of poorly implemented.
所以它确实更好了，但实现方式有点糟糕。

1929
01:25:25,577 --> 01:25:26,160
Like, come on.
拜托。

1930
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:27,785
I just wanted to say hello comma David.
我只是想说一句“你好，大卫”。

1931
01:25:27,785 --> 01:25:28,785
Why is that hard?
为什么这么难？

1932
01:25:28,785 --> 01:25:31,410
Well, maybe we can actually combine these a little differently.
好吧，也许我们可以以不同的方式组合这些。

1933
01:25:31,410 --> 01:25:32,610
And let me propose this.
让我来提议一下。

1934
01:25:32,610 --> 01:25:35,760
Let me actually get rid of these blocks again.
让我把这些块再次删除。

1935
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,430
And let me go ahead and just say one thing.
让我继续说一件事。

1936
01:25:38,430 --> 01:25:43,650
But can I somehow combine this to say hello comma David all in one breath?
但我能以某种方式将这些组合起来，一次性说出“你好，大卫”吗？

1937
01:25:43,650 --> 01:25:46,348
Well, it turns out if I go under Operators,
事实证明，如果我在“操作符”下，

1938
01:25:46,348 --> 01:25:49,140
I know from having played with this before that there's this puzzle
我之前玩过这个，我知道这里有一个名为“连接”的拼图

1939
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:51,030
piece down here called join.
块。

1940
01:25:51,030 --> 01:25:52,463
It's an oval.
它是一个椭圆形。

1941
01:25:52,463 --> 01:25:54,630
It's a little big, but, again, it will grow to fill.
它有点大，但同样，它会增长以填满。

1942
01:25:54,630 --> 01:25:57,338
And by default, it wants to join two words, "apple" and "banana."
默认情况下，它想连接两个词，“苹果”和“香蕉”。

1943
01:25:57,338 --> 01:25:59,830
But those are just placeholders.
但这些只是占位符。

1944
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:03,990
So let me go ahead and drag this over the default hello.
所以我把它拖到默认的“你好”上。

1945
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:08,700
Let me change "apple" to hello comma space and then banana.
我把它改为“你好，空格，然后是香蕉”。

1946
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,230
Let me go back to Sensing.
我回到“感知”。

1947
01:26:10,230 --> 01:26:13,630
Let me grab answer and drag and drop that.
我抓住“回答”，然后拖放它。

1948
01:26:13,630 --> 01:26:16,740
So now notice that I'm kind of layering my ideas.
所以现在注意，我有点分层地构建我的想法。

1949
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:20,980
And put another way, the output of this join block
换句话说，这个“连接”块的输出

1950
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:22,980
is presumably going to join two things together,
可能会将两件事连接在一起，

1951
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:25,110
apple and banana or hello comma David.
苹果和香蕉，或者“你好，大卫”。

1952
01:26:25,110 --> 01:26:29,460
And then the output of join is going to become the input to say.
然后“连接”的输出将成为“说”的输入。

1953
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:31,900
So aesthetically, it just looks better.
所以从美学上来说，它看起来更好。

1954
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:33,790
It's still correct, but it's just better.
它仍然是正确的，但它确实更好。

1955
01:26:33,790 --> 01:26:36,840
So if I type "David," and hit Enter, hello, David.
所以我输入“大卫”，然后按下回车键，“你好，大卫”。

1956
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:38,820
This is what a normal program would presumably
这正是正常程序应该做的事情，

1957
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:42,390
do, not show you part of the phrase and then the rest of the phrase.
而不是只显示一部分短语，然后是短语的剩余部分。

1958
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:44,230
Like, it's just better in this way.
就像，它以这种方式更好。

1959
01:26:44,230 --> 01:26:48,480
So let's connect this now to this same puzzle piece and this methodology.
所以让我们现在将它连接到这个相同的拼图块和这种方法。

1960
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,610
So here's that same puzzle piece, ask.
所以这是同一个拼图块，“询问”。

1961
01:26:50,610 --> 01:26:53,520
How do we fit it into this input and output flow with algorithms?
我们如何用算法将它融入这个输入和输出流？

1962
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:57,120
Well, the input to that puzzle piece is something like, what's your name,
嗯，那个拼图块的输入是类似这样的东西，你的名字是，

1963
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,200
question mark.
问号。

1964
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:01,680
Then the algorithm or the code implementation thereof
然后算法，或者它的代码实现

1965
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:06,240
is this ask block and wait so the human has a moment to type their response in.
就是这个“询问”块和“等待”，以便用户有时间输入他们的回应。

1966
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:09,548
The output of that function recall is a return value.
请记住，那个函数的输出是一个返回值。

1967
01:27:09,548 --> 01:27:12,840
You don't see anything on the screen by default because we've not used say yet,
默认情况下你不会在屏幕上看到任何东西，因为我们还没有使用“说”，

1968
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:14,860
but we get this return value.
但我们得到了这个返回值。

1969
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:18,120
And let me scooch everything over now so that we can now
现在让我把所有东西都移过去，这样我们就可以

1970
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:20,110
join those inputs together.
将这些输入连接在一起。

1971
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:21,610
So here's this puzzle piece.
所以这是这个拼图块。

1972
01:27:21,610 --> 01:27:24,940
Let me go ahead and propose that the inputs now to the join block
让我提议一下，现在“连接”块的输入

1973
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:30,100
are two arguments or two parameters, so to speak, hello and answer.
是两个参数，或者说两个参数，分别是“你好”和“回答”。

1974
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:32,740
They go into that join puzzle piece, whose purpose in life
它们进入那个“连接”拼图块，它存在的意义

1975
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:36,040
is to return one joined version thereof.
就是返回一个连接在一起的版本。

1976
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:38,470
Let me slide this all over logically now so
现在让我逻辑地把这些都移过去，所以

1977
01:27:38,470 --> 01:27:42,850
that now that output becomes the input to the say block
现在那个输出就变成了“说”块的输入

1978
01:27:42,850 --> 01:27:46,330
and now is why the cat has the speech bubble saying all at once,
现在也解释了为什么猫的对话框里一次性显示了“你好，大卫”。

1979
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:47,740
hello comma David.
“你好，大卫”。

1980
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:51,620
So what we've done here is kind of composed the output
所以我们在这里做的事情是将输出

1981
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:54,017
and from one function into the input of another.
从一个函数组合到另一个函数的输入。

1982
01:27:54,017 --> 01:27:56,350
And you can think of this in a couple of different ways,
你可以从几个不同的角度来思考这一点，

1983
01:27:56,350 --> 01:27:58,150
left to right, as I did there, or kind of
从左到右，就像我之前做的那样，或者类似

1984
01:27:58,150 --> 01:28:00,740
like stacking these things on top of one another.
将这些东西叠放在一起。

1985
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:02,860
But at the end of the day, even as programming
但归根结底，即使是编程

1986
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:07,510
gets more and more powerful for us, it's just inputs and outputs, inputs
变得越来越强大，它也仅仅是输入和输出，输入

1987
01:28:07,510 --> 01:28:08,320
and outputs.
和输出。

1988
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:11,230
And thankfully, with built-in functionality from our friends
幸运的是，借助来自我们朋友

1989
01:28:11,230 --> 01:28:14,680
at MIT who designed Scratch, I can even do something playful like this.
麻省理工学院（MIT）的设计的 Scratch 的内置功能，我甚至可以做一些像这样的有趣的事情。

1990
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:16,990
I can go to that Extensions button at the bottom.
我可以点击底部那个“扩展”按钮。

这里有很多花哨的东西可以添加，比如文字转语音。

1992
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:22,680
So let me go ahead and choose text-to-speech.
所以让我选择“文字转语音”。

1993
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:28,050
And let me go ahead here and change the say block in purple.
让我在这里把紫色的“说”块换掉。

And I think it's just about to be a little more interesting.

And you might now remember how we began class, where

2009
01:28:56,830 --> 01:28:59,080
we had a robotic, computerized voice.
我们用了一个机械的，电脑化的声音。

2010
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:03,168
Well, we didn't use Scratch at the time, but we could change this in Scratch
好吧，当时我们没有使用 Scratch，但我们可以用 Scratch

2011
01:29:03,168 --> 01:29:04,460
alone to be a little different.

DAVID J. MALAN: OK.
大卫·J·马兰：好的。

2015
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:10,070
Little creepy, but we can play all day long with that.

2016
01:29:10,070 --> 01:29:12,125
But the point is that these functions are just

now doing something a little different.

01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:15,792
But it's just these inputs and outputs.

and drag the play sound meow until done.

2023

And here too it comes with meow.

2024
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:31,697
You can add your own sounds as well.

01:29:31,697 --> 01:29:34,030
But I'm just going to use the default meow and here too.

2026
01:29:34,030 --> 01:29:35,447
Hopefully, this won't be too loud.
希望这不会太吵。

2027
01:29:35,447 --> 01:29:37,360
Let's make the cat meow by clicking Play.
让我们点击播放让猫叫。

2028
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:39,530
[MEOWING]
[猫叫]

2029
01:29:39,530 --> 01:29:40,030
OK.
好的。

2030
01:29:40,030 --> 01:29:42,200
It's a little piercing, but it's cute.
有点尖锐，但很可爱。

2031
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:45,490
And if I want the cat to meow twice, I could just play the game twice.
如果我想让猫叫两次，我就可以玩两次游戏。

2032
01:29:45,490 --> 01:29:48,410
[MEOWING]
[猫叫]

2033
01:29:48,410 --> 01:29:48,910
All right.
好的。

2034
01:29:48,910 --> 01:29:52,360
But it would be nice to just get it to meow automatically two, or three,
但是，如果能让它自动叫两声，三声，

2035
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:53,240
or more times.
甚至更多次，那就更好了。

2036
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:54,760
So you know what I could do?
你知道我该怎么做吗？

2037
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:56,820
I could just drag a second one of these.
我可以再拖一个这样的模块过来。

2038
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:57,820
Actually, you know what?

2039
01:29:57,820 --> 01:30:00,790
I could even just right-click or Control-click and duplicate them.
我甚至可以右键单击或使用 Ctrl 键单击并复制它们。

2040
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:02,110
But I'll just keep dragging and dropping.
但我还是会一直拖放。

2041
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:03,670
There's different ways to solve problems.

01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:07,370
[MEOWING]
[猫叫]

2044
01:30:07,370 --> 01:30:07,870
OK.
好的。

2045
01:30:07,870 --> 01:30:09,940
Cat does not sound particularly happy.
这猫听起来不太开心。

2046
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:12,320
So we could go under--
所以我们可以去下面——

2047
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:13,690
how about Control?
试试控制键？

2048
01:30:13,690 --> 01:30:15,220
We could wait one second.
我们可以等待一秒钟。

2049
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:18,740
Now, there's no room, but it will sort of expand to give room for me.
现在没有空间了，但它会自动扩展，为我腾出空间。

2050
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:19,900
So let me try this.
所以让我试试这个。

2051
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:22,540
And now it's going to wait one second in between meows.
现在它会在两次猫叫之间等待一秒钟。

2052
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:25,828
[MEOWING]
[猫叫]

2053
01:30:26,820 --> 01:30:27,330
OK.
好的。

2054
01:30:27,330 --> 01:30:28,830
Let me stipulate that is correct.
我声明这是正确的。

2055
01:30:28,830 --> 01:30:32,190
If my goal is to get the cat to meow three times, it meowed three times.
如果我的目标是让猫叫三次，它就叫了三次。

2056
01:30:32,190 --> 01:30:36,640
But per our discussion earlier of algorithms and the design thereof,
但是根据我们之前讨论的算法及其设计，

2057
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,770
this is not the best design.
这不是最好的设计。

2058
01:30:38,770 --> 01:30:39,760
[MEOWING]
[猫叫]

2059
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:40,260
OK?
好吗？

2060
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:40,500
[LAUGHTER]
[笑声]

2061
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,000
Thank you for playing along at home.
感谢您在家参与互动。

2062
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,350
Yeah.
是的。

2063
01:30:43,350 --> 01:30:47,050
In what sense is this arguably not well-designed?
为什么可以说它设计不好呢？

2064
01:30:47,050 --> 01:30:47,550
Yeah.
是的。

2065
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:48,930
AUDIENCE: You repeated yourself.
观众：你重复了自己。

2066
01:30:48,930 --> 01:30:51,600
DAVID J. MALAN: I repeated myself, which actually in programming
大卫·J·马兰：我重复了自己，这在编程中其实

2067
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,440
tends not to be a good thing.
通常不是一件好事。

2068
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:54,510
Now, it was easy.
现在，这很简单。

2069
01:30:54,510 --> 01:30:57,510
I almost resorted to copy-paste, which saves me time upfront.
我差点就用复制粘贴了，这在前期可以节省时间。

2070
01:30:57,510 --> 01:30:59,400
But just imagine a contrived scenario.
但想象一下一个牵强的场景。

2071
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,350
Now, what if I want it to wait like two seconds in between?
现在，如果我想让它在两次猫叫之间等待两秒钟呢？

2072
01:31:02,350 --> 01:31:02,850
All right.
好的。

2073
01:31:02,850 --> 01:31:03,940
It's not that big a deal.
这没什么大不了的。

2074
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:05,640
I change it here, and I change it here.
我在这里修改一下，在这里也修改一下。

2075
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:07,913
But what if the program is meant to meow 10 times?
但如果程序要让猫叫 10 次呢？

2076
01:31:07,913 --> 01:31:10,830
Then I have to change it here, and here, and here, and here, and here.
然后我必须在这里修改，在这里修改，在这里修改，在这里修改，在这里修改。

2077
01:31:10,830 --> 01:31:12,570
And eventually I'm going to screw up.
最后我肯定会出错。

2078
01:31:12,570 --> 01:31:13,470
Humans are fallible.
人都会犯错。

2079
01:31:13,470 --> 01:31:14,970
I'm going to overlook one of them.
我会漏掉其中一个。

2080
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:16,260
One time, it's going to be one second.
一次会是一秒钟。

2081
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:18,910
Another is going to be two, and just stupid things will happen.
另一次会是两秒，然后就会发生一些愚蠢的事情。

2082
01:31:18,910 --> 01:31:23,050
You're setting yourself up for failure if you design things poorly.
如果你设计的东西很糟糕，就会给自己埋下失败的种子。

2083
01:31:23,050 --> 01:31:26,440
And so I would propose that we use another type of building block
所以，我建议我们使用另一种类型的构建块

2084
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:27,730
to solve this instead.
来解决这个问题。

2085
01:31:27,730 --> 01:31:28,555
Yeah.
是的。

2086
01:31:28,555 --> 01:31:28,810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
观众：[听不清]

2087
01:31:28,810 --> 01:31:29,685
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah.
大卫·J·马兰：是的。

2088
01:31:29,685 --> 01:31:32,950
So we could use a loop and just write minimal code
所以我们可以使用循环，只写最少的代码

2089
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:35,240
but to accomplish even more functionality.
但可以实现更多的功能。

2090
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,390
So let me throw away most of these blocks.
所以让我丢掉大部分的模块。

2091
01:31:37,390 --> 01:31:40,990
And let's go and grab this repeat block, which we haven't used yet,
然后让我们去获取这个重复模块，我们还没有使用过它，

2092
01:31:40,990 --> 01:31:42,042
but it's right there.
但它就在那里。

2093
01:31:42,042 --> 01:31:43,750
And as the name suggests, this will allow
正如它的名字所暗示的那样，这将允许

2094
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:45,850
me to repeat something some number of times.
我重复某件事若干次。

2095
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:48,280
Let me put these two puzzle pieces inside.
让我把这两块拼图放进去。

2096
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:49,330
It'll grow to fill.
它会自动填充。

2097
01:31:49,330 --> 01:31:51,370
Let me reconnect it to the green flag.
让我把它重新连接到绿色旗帜上。

2098
01:31:51,370 --> 01:31:53,470
I'll change the default 10 to a 3.
我会把默认的 10 改成 3。

2099
01:31:53,470 --> 01:31:54,265
And now--
现在——

2100
01:31:54,265 --> 01:31:57,526
[MEOWING]
[猫叫]

2101
01:31:58,940 --> 01:32:02,290
It's just sort of better because if now you want it to meow more times,
它更好，因为现在如果你想让它叫更多次，

2102
01:32:02,290 --> 01:32:03,290
you change it one place.
你只需要修改一个地方。

2103
01:32:03,290 --> 01:32:05,623
If you want it to slow down, you change it in one place.
如果你想让它慢下来，你只需要修改一个地方。

2104
01:32:05,623 --> 01:32:07,280
There's no room for error.
没有出错的空间。

2105
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:09,920
And that's generally a good thing.
这通常是一件好事。

2106
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:10,670
But this is silly.
但这太可笑了。

2107
01:32:10,670 --> 01:32:12,350
Like, Scratch comes with a cat.
比如说，Scratch 自带一只猫。

2108
01:32:12,350 --> 01:32:15,590
Why didn't MIT give us a puzzle piece called "meow?"
为什么麻省理工学院没有给我们一个叫做“喵”的拼图模块？

2109
01:32:15,590 --> 01:32:18,460
Like, why am I implementing the idea of meowing myself?
就像，为什么我要自己实现“喵”这个概念？

2110
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:19,460
Like, that took me what?
就像，那花了我的什么？

2111
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:21,410
1, 2, 3, 4 puzzle pieces.
1、2、3、4 个拼图模块。

2112
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:24,080
Why isn't there just one puzzle piece that meows for me?
为什么没有一个拼图模块能帮我叫“喵”？

2113
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:28,430
This too we can do in code, be it in Scratch, or C, or other languages too.
我们也可以在代码中做到这一点，无论是 Scratch、C 还是其他语言。

2114
01:32:28,430 --> 01:32:32,660
I'm going to go down to these pink my blocks here,
我会去下面这些粉色的我的模块，

2115
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:35,027
where I can create my own puzzle piece.
在那里我可以创建自己的拼图模块。

2116
01:32:35,027 --> 01:32:36,860
And I'm going to call this literally "meow."
我会把它命名为“喵”。

2117
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:39,150
And I'm going to go ahead and just click OK.
然后我就会点击确定。

2118
01:32:39,150 --> 01:32:42,242
And notice that it's given me this new type of start connector.
注意，它给了我这种新的启动连接器。

2119
01:32:42,242 --> 01:32:44,450
It's a start puzzle piece that nothing goes above it.
这是一个启动拼图模块，上面没有其他模块。

2120
01:32:44,450 --> 01:32:46,430
But you can put anything you want below it.
但你可以在它下面放任何你想放的东西。

2121
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:48,170
And I'm going to go ahead and cheat here.
然后我会在这里作弊。

2122
01:32:48,170 --> 01:32:51,390
I'm just going to grab my existing code, so to speak.
我将获取我现有的代码，可以说。

2123
01:32:51,390 --> 01:32:53,810
This is code I'm writing, even though it's puzzle pieces.
尽管它像拼图一样，但这也是我在写代码。

2124
01:32:53,810 --> 01:32:57,380
And now let me just claim, and I'll move this aside.
现在让我声明一下，我会把这个放到一边。

2125
01:32:57,380 --> 01:33:00,690
Here is now an implementation of my own function,
现在，这是我自己实现的函数，

2126
01:33:00,690 --> 01:33:03,510
my own block called "meow," whose purpose in life
我自己的积木叫做“喵”，它存在的意义

2127
01:33:03,510 --> 01:33:06,180
is to meow until done and then wait one second.
就是一直喵到结束，然后等待一秒钟。

2128
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:10,350
But what's powerful now is notice at top left, now that I've made the block,
但现在很强大的地方是，请注意左上角，现在我已经做好了积木，

2129
01:33:10,350 --> 01:33:12,910
I can use it any number of times.
我可以使用它任意多次。

2130
01:33:12,910 --> 01:33:17,520
So I can grab this meow block, drag it over here, and you know what?
所以我可以抓住这个“喵”积木，把它拖到这里，你知道吗？

2131
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:21,590
Now that "meow" exists as an idea, I can abstract that away.
现在“喵”作为一种概念存在，我可以把它抽象出来。

2132
01:33:21,590 --> 01:33:24,090
And I'm just going to arbitrarily drag it way to the bottom.
我就要把它随意拖到最底部。

2133
01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:24,990
I'm not deleting it.
我没有把它删除。

2134
01:33:24,990 --> 01:33:27,270
I'm just putting it out of sight, out of mind so
我只是把它隐藏起来，不再去想它，这样

2135
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:28,890
that we can focus now on this idea.
我们现在就可以专注于这个概念了。

2136
01:33:28,890 --> 01:33:31,410
And I claim that this implementation of meowing
我声称这种“喵”的实现方式

2137
01:33:31,410 --> 01:33:35,010
is sort of better because it's more compact, it does what it says,
在某种程度上更好，因为它更加紧凑，它做到了它所描述的，

2138
01:33:35,010 --> 01:33:38,520
and I don't care about the implementation details of "meow."
而且我并不关心“喵”的实现细节。

2139
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:41,640
So this idea of abstraction, something we're going to use frequently.
所以这个抽象的概念，我们将会经常用到。

2140
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:44,767
To abstract something away is to simplify.
将某些东西抽象出来就是简化。

2141
01:33:44,767 --> 01:33:47,100
Don't think about the underlying implementation details.
不要去想底层的实现细节。

2142
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:50,130
Just care about what it does or what it's called.
只需要关心它做什么或者它的名字是什么。

2143
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:52,590
Someone has to care about the implementation details,
有人必须关心实现细节，

2144
01:33:52,590 --> 01:33:54,330
like me 30 seconds ago.
就像我 30 秒前那样。

2145
01:33:54,330 --> 01:33:56,430
But here on out, I don't need to care.
但从现在开始，我不需要再关心了。

2146
01:33:56,430 --> 01:33:59,690
And so in fact, you and I are using the abstraction
实际上，你和我都在使用 Scratch 的抽象，

2147
01:33:59,690 --> 01:34:02,940
that is Scratch because I don't know how to put a speech bubble on the screen.
因为我不知道如何在屏幕上放一个对话框。

2148
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:04,773
I don't know how to create that sound, meow.
我也不知道如何创建那个声音“喵”。

2149
01:34:04,773 --> 01:34:07,380
MIT did that, and they abstracted those pieces
麻省理工学院做到了这一点，他们把这些部分

2150
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:10,440
of functionality away already for us by just giving us
的功能抽象出来，并直接给了我们

2151
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:12,280
these puzzle pieces we see here.
这些我们在这里看到的拼图。

2152
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:14,445
So the code will work the exact same.
所以代码将完全一样地工作。

2153
01:34:14,445 --> 01:34:17,330
[MEOWING]
[喵叫声]

2154
01:34:17,330 --> 01:34:21,640
But it's sort of better designed now because now I've
但现在它设计得更好了一些，因为现在我已经

2155
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:23,470
abstracted away the idea of meowing.
将“喵”的概念抽象出来了。

2156
01:34:23,470 --> 01:34:25,690
But I bet I can improve this further.
但我相信我还可以进一步改进它。

2157
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:28,390
Can I get rid of the repeat block altogether?
我可以完全去掉重复积木吗？

2158
01:34:28,390 --> 01:34:31,510
And let me just tell the meow block how many times to meow.
让我直接告诉“喵”积木要喵多少次。

2159
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:35,170
Well, let me go down to the bottom and look at the implementation details.
好吧，让我到最底部看一下实现细节。

2160
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:37,270
I'm going to right-click or Control-click on this,
我要右键单击或 Control-单击它，

2161
01:34:37,270 --> 01:34:38,210
and I'm going to edit it.
我要编辑它。

2162
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:39,290
So I'm going to make a change.
所以我要做一些修改。

2163
01:34:39,290 --> 01:34:42,290
And I didn't do this before, but I'm going to call it "meow," as before.
我以前没有这样做，但我现在要把它叫做“喵”，和以前一样。

2164
01:34:42,290 --> 01:34:43,780
I'm going to add an input.
我要添加一个输入。

2165
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:46,240
And just so I know what it says what it does,
为了让我知道它做了什么，

2166
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:49,000
I'm going to add the word "times" here.
我要在这里添加单词“times”。

2167
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,840
And I'm going to change this placeholder to n.
我要将这个占位符更改为 n。

2168
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,970
n for "number" is the go-to placeholder any time
n 代表“number”，是我们在计算机科学中想要谈论一个数字时最常用的占位符。

2169
01:34:54,970 --> 01:34:57,230
we want to talk about a number in CS.
我们在计算机科学中想要谈论一个数字时最常用的占位符。

2170
01:34:57,230 --> 01:35:00,020
So now notice the puzzle piece looks a little different.
所以现在请注意这个拼图看起来有点不同。

2171
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:02,830
It takes an argument or a parameter called
它接收一个参数，叫做

2172
01:35:02,830 --> 01:35:05,680
n, which represents the number of times you want the thing to meow.
n，它代表你想要这个东西喵的次数。

2173
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:07,280
Now, that doesn't do that yet.
现在，它还没有做到这一点。

2174
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:10,240
So let me go back to my other code.
所以让我回到我的另一段代码。

2175
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:13,210
Let me just decouple these temporarily.
让我先暂时将它们分开。

2176
01:35:13,210 --> 01:35:17,950
I'm going to move my loop into my implementation of meowing.
我要把我的循环移动到“喵”的实现中。

2177
01:35:17,950 --> 01:35:21,950
But I don't want to hard code, that is literally write the number 3 anymore.
但我不想再硬编码了，也就是不再直接写数字 3。

2178
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:25,860
I'm going to grab this oval and put it there.
我要抓住这个椭圆形，把它放到那里。

2179
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:27,900
So now I've generalized the function.
所以现在我已经将这个函数泛化了。

2180
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:33,860
So now it will meow any number of times, 0 on up, by executing that loop
所以现在它可以喵任意多次，从 0 开始，通过执行那个循环

2181
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:35,540
and now more powerfully.
而现在更加强大。

2182
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:36,890
Out of sight, out of mind.
眼不见，心不烦。

2183
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:40,850
Notice that my code just became so darn simple.
请注意，我的代码变得如此简单。

2184
01:35:40,850 --> 01:35:42,650
Like, my function is called "meow."
比如，我的函数叫做“喵”。

2185
01:35:42,650 --> 01:35:44,330
It meows some number of times.
它喵叫一定次数。

2186
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:46,910
All I have to do is type a number there, and it just works.
我所要做的就是在那里输入一个数字，它就能正常工作。

2187
01:35:46,910 --> 01:35:50,660
And I don't care any more about those lower-level, so to speak,
我再也不关心那些更底层的，可以这么说，

2188
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:52,230
implementation details.
实现细节了。

2189
01:35:52,230 --> 01:35:53,270
So here, no surprise.
所以在这里，不出所料。

2190
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:55,985
If I type in the number 3, zoom out, and hit Play--
如果我输入数字 3，缩小，然后点击播放——

2191
01:35:55,985 --> 01:36:00,270
[MEOWING]
[喵叫声]

2192
01:36:00,270 --> 01:36:02,500
--it still works just fine.
——它仍然可以正常工作。

2193
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:05,460
So any questions on what we've just done here?
所以关于我们刚刚做的事情，有什么问题吗？

2194
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:07,710
It's still just meowing, but that's besides the point.
它仍然只是在喵叫，但这并不是重点。

2195
01:36:07,710 --> 01:36:11,340
It's this creation of our own functions, this modularity,
是我们自己创建函数，这种模块化，

2196
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:15,640
this abstraction that's going to be the idea that keeps coming back to us.
这种抽象，将是我们反复出现的概念。

2197
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:16,140
No?
没有？

2198
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:16,640
All right.
好吧。

2199
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:19,050
So let's make this a little more cat-like.
所以让我们让它更像猫一些。

2200
01:36:19,050 --> 01:36:20,980
Let me throw away all of this code.
让我丢掉所有这些代码。

2201
01:36:20,980 --> 01:36:22,000
And let me go ahead--
然后我开始——

2202
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,000
oops-- let me throw away this code first and then the rest of this code.
哎呦——让我先丢掉这段代码，然后再丢掉剩下的代码。

2203
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,500
And let me go ahead and give myself another green flag block.
然后我开始，再给自己一个绿色旗帜积木。

2204
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:32,430
And let me go ahead, and let's create a cat that allows us to pet it
然后我开始，我们创建一个猫，让我们可以抚摸它

2205
01:36:32,430 --> 01:36:34,530
by moving my cursor over the cat.
通过将我的光标移到猫的上面。

2206
01:36:34,530 --> 01:36:36,820
And maybe it likes that, so it'll meow when I do that.
也许它喜欢这样，所以当我这样做的时候，它就会喵叫。

2207
01:36:36,820 --> 01:36:42,270
So let me go under Control, and let me grab this if conditional,
所以让我到控制下面，然后抓住这个 if 条件语句，

2208
01:36:42,270 --> 01:36:44,910
which we talked about as a building block earlier.
我们之前把它当作一个构建块讨论过。

2209
01:36:44,910 --> 01:36:47,310
Let me go to Sensing, and we haven't used this before.
让我到感知下面，我们以前没有使用过这个。

2210
01:36:47,310 --> 01:36:50,130
But here is a weird sort of diagonal shape
但是这里有一个奇怪的斜线形状

2211
01:36:50,130 --> 01:36:52,440
that says touching mouse pointer question mark.
上面写着“触摸鼠标指针”问号。

2212
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:54,027
So that's a Boolean expression.
所以这是一个布尔表达式。

2213
01:36:54,027 --> 01:36:56,610
So I'm going to drag that, and it's definitely the wrong size.
所以我要拖动它，它显然大小不对。

2214
01:36:56,610 --> 01:36:59,070
But it is the right shape, so it will grow to fill.
但它的形状是对的，所以它会扩展到填满。

2215
01:36:59,070 --> 01:37:03,820
And the question I want to ask is if the cat is touching the mouse pointer,
而我想问的问题是，如果猫正在触摸鼠标指针，

2216
01:37:03,820 --> 01:37:05,770
then go ahead and meow happily.
那就继续开心地喵叫。

2217
01:37:05,770 --> 01:37:08,360
So let me grab the meow sound, put it in there.
所以让我抓住“喵”的声音，把它放到那里。

2218
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:12,970
And so I think when I click the green flag to start the program,
所以我想当我点击绿色旗帜开始程序的时候，

2219
01:37:12,970 --> 01:37:19,174
and now I let the mouse pointer touch the cat, we should hear--
现在我让鼠标指针碰到猫，我们应该听到——

2220
01:37:19,174 --> 01:37:20,110
huh.
咦。

2221
01:37:20,110 --> 01:37:21,120
huh.
咦。

2222
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:23,820
Doesn't seem to be working.
好像没有起作用。

2223
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:27,440
There's a bug or a mistake in this program too.

2224
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:28,440
What did I do wrong?
我做错了什么？

2225
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:28,940
Yeah.
是的。

2226
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:31,090
AUDIENCE: You didn't specify the sprite [INAUDIBLE]..
观众：你没有指定精灵[听不清]。

2227
01:37:31,090 --> 01:37:33,130
DAVID J. MALAN: I don't need to specify the sprite explicitly
大卫·J·马兰：我不需要明确地指定精灵

2228
01:37:33,130 --> 01:37:35,200
because a detail I didn't discuss earlier.
因为之前我还没讲过一个细节。

2229
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:37,630
In the bottom right of the screen, notice
在屏幕的右下角，注意

2230
01:37:37,630 --> 01:37:39,890
that the cat is already selected.
猫已经被选中了。

2231
01:37:39,890 --> 01:37:42,100
So this code relates to that cat.
所以这段代码与那只猫相关。

2232
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:45,340
So your instinct is good if we had two or more sprites,
所以你的直觉没错，如果我们有两个或多个精灵，

2233
01:37:45,340 --> 01:37:48,045
but I just have one, so I'm covered there.
但我只有一个，所以这里就不用担心了。

2234
01:37:48,045 --> 01:37:48,670
Other thoughts.
还有其他想法吗？

2235
01:37:48,670 --> 01:37:49,602
Yeah.
是的。

2236
01:37:49,602 --> 01:37:50,870
AUDIENCE: It only checks once.
观众：它只检查一次。

2237
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:51,980
DAVID J. MALAN: It only checks?

DAVID J. MALAN: Once.
大卫·J·马兰：一次。

2240
01:37:53,125 --> 01:37:54,960
So I click the green flag.
所以我点击了绿色旗帜。

2241
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:57,230
The computer did what I told it to do.
电脑做了我告诉它做的事情。

2242
01:37:57,230 --> 01:38:00,165
The mouse pointer was not touching the cat at that moment
那个时候鼠标指针没有接触到猫

2243
01:38:00,165 --> 01:38:01,790
because it was touching the green flag.
因为它接触到了绿色旗帜。

2244
01:38:01,790 --> 01:38:03,320
So, of course, it didn't meow.
所以，当然，它没有喵喵叫。

2245
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:05,360
So what maybe is the fix here?
所以，也许，这里的解决方案是什么？

2246
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:06,980
What puzzle piece can we add?
我们能添加什么拼图？

2247
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:09,290
AUDIENCE: After the green flag is [INAUDIBLE]..
观众：在绿色旗帜被[听不清]之后...

2248
01:38:09,290 --> 01:38:10,140
DAVID J. MALAN: OK.
大卫·J·马兰：好的。

2249

OK.
好的。

2250
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:12,360
Interesting solution.
有趣的解决方案。

2251
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:17,930
So let me go ahead, and under Control let me grab a-- wait one second.
所以让我继续，在控制下让我抓取一个——等等。

2252
01:38:17,930 --> 01:38:21,360
I'm going to change the 1 to 5, and now I'm going to click the green flag.
我要把 1 改成 5，现在我要点击绿色旗帜。

2253
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:22,370
So here we go.
开始了。

2254
01:38:22,370 --> 01:38:28,490
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
1，2，3，4，5。

2255
01:38:28,490 --> 01:38:29,060
Damn it.
该死。

2256
01:38:29,060 --> 01:38:29,630
[MEOWING]
[喵喵叫]

2257
01:38:29,630 --> 01:38:29,810
OK.
好的。

2258

2265
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:42,230
So your approach would work, but it's very much a hack, if you will.
所以你的方法是可行的，但如果可以的话，它非常像个黑客手段。

2266
01:38:42,230 --> 01:38:46,700
Like, I would have to time it perfectly so that the mouse pointer is touching
比如，我必须精确地计时，以便鼠标指针接触到

2267
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:49,040
it, or, conversely, I have to drag it there and just
它，或者相反，我必须把它拖过去，然后就

2268
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:50,540
leave it there for five seconds.
把它放在那里五秒钟。

2269
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:53,040
And that's a little weird because you don't just touch a cat
这有点奇怪，因为你不会仅仅触碰一只猫

2270
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:54,960
and then five seconds later it meows at you.
然后五秒钟后它就对你喵喵叫。

2271
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:57,190
Like, presumably, we want it to be more interactive.
我们想要它更具交互性。

2272
01:38:57,190 --> 01:38:58,660
So I like this idea of a loop.
所以我喜欢循环的想法。

2273
01:38:58,660 --> 01:38:59,160
Right?
对吧？

2274
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:04,440
Why don't we just tell the cat to forever listen for the cursor
为什么我们不直接告诉猫永远监听光标

2275
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:07,170
as by using not repeat but forever?
通过使用forever而不是repeat？

2276
01:39:07,170 --> 01:39:08,240
Let me move this in here.
让我把它移到这里。

2277
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:11,490
So now the cat's going to be told when the green flag is clicked just forever,
所以现在猫被告知，当点击绿色旗帜时，永远

2278
01:39:11,490 --> 01:39:13,073
if touching, if touching, if touching.
如果接触，如果接触，如果接触。

2279
01:39:13,073 --> 01:39:15,270
Oh, meow when actually touched.
哦，当真正接触时喵喵叫。

2280
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:19,368
So now if I zoom out and hit Play, nothing's happening.
所以，如果我现在缩小然后点击播放，什么也没发生。

2281
01:39:19,368 --> 01:39:21,160
I don't have to wait any number of seconds.
我不需要等待任何秒数。

2282
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:22,545
But when I do touch the cat--
但当我接触到猫的时候——

2283
01:39:22,545 --> 01:39:23,260
[MEOWING]
[喵喵叫]

2284
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:24,180

[MEOWING]
[喵喵叫]

2288
01:39:27,765 --> 01:39:30,890
So now it's actually working quite well.
所以现在它运行得相当好。

2289
01:39:30,890 --> 01:39:33,220
So there we have sort of a logical bug.
所以我们这里有一个逻辑错误。

2290
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:35,545
But it does make sense if you think about what it was
但如果你想想你实际告诉计算机做的事情，就会发现它是合理的。

2291
01:39:35,545 --> 01:39:38,020
you told the computer to actually do.
你实际告诉计算机做的事情。

2292
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:39,915
Well, let's make things even more interesting
好吧，让我们让事情更有趣一些

2293
01:39:39,915 --> 01:39:41,290
by using one of these extensions.
通过使用这些扩展中的一个。

2294
01:39:41,290 --> 01:39:44,620
In this bottom left corner, this is how I got to text-to-speech earlier.
在这个左下角，这是我之前如何实现文本转语音的。

2295
01:39:44,620 --> 01:39:47,470
Let me go to Video Sensing over here too.
我也去看看这里的视频传感。

2296
01:39:47,470 --> 01:39:50,750
And I can actually-- there we go-- literally, the video has come on.
我实际上——好了——实际上，视频开始了。

2297
01:39:50,750 --> 01:39:52,060
Let me go ahead and do this.
让我继续做这个。

2298
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:55,690
Get rid of this code, and let me step out of the frame.
删除这段代码，让我走出画面。

2299
01:39:55,690 --> 01:39:58,540
When video motion is greater than--
当视频运动大于——

2300
01:39:58,540 --> 01:40:00,490
well, this is CS50, so let's just type in 50,
好吧，这是 CS50，所以我们输入 50，

2301
01:40:00,490 --> 01:40:02,150
which is just a measure of motion.
这只是一个运动的衡量标准。

2302
01:40:02,150 --> 01:40:07,370
Let me go and play sound meow.
让我去播放喵喵的声音。

2303
01:40:07,370 --> 01:40:07,870
OK.
好的。

2304
01:40:07,870 --> 01:40:11,720
And let me stop and restart.
让我停止并重新开始。

2305
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:12,220
All right.
好的。

2306
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:13,030
So there's the cat.
所以，这就是猫。

2307
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:19,260
[MEOWING]
[喵喵叫]

01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:20,040

It worked.
它成功了。

2310
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:24,330
The cat's a little insensitive.

2311
01:40:24,330 --> 01:40:25,190
[MEOWING]
[喵喵叫]

2312
01:40:25,190 --> 01:40:25,720
There we go.
好了。

2313
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:26,720
Actually, you know what?
实际上，你知道吗？

2314
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:30,300
Maybe it's just-- let me put-- let's change it.
也许就是——让我放——让我们改变它。

2315
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:31,130
20.
20。

2316
01:40:31,130 --> 01:40:31,940
Oh, my God.
我的天啊。

2317
01:40:31,940 --> 01:40:33,480
Oh, that's OK.

[MEOWING]
[喵喵叫]

2319
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:34,790
There we go.
好了。

2320
01:40:34,790 --> 01:40:35,690
All right.
好的。

2321
01:40:35,690 --> 01:40:36,420
There we go.
好了。

2322
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:40,038
So now it's a little more sensitive to the petting by using the camera.
所以现在它对使用摄像头进行抚摸更加敏感了。

2323
01:40:40,038 --> 01:40:41,580
Now, this is kind of a weird example.
现在，这是一个有点奇怪的例子。

2324
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:43,160
And if I just start moving around crazily, like,
如果我开始疯狂地四处乱动，就像，

2325
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:45,320
it's just going to meow incessantly, which was what was happening--
它就会不停地喵喵叫，这就是当时发生的事情——

2326
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:46,430
[MEOWING]
[喵喵叫]

2327
01:40:46,430 --> 01:40:48,222
Stop.
停下来。

2328
01:40:48,222 --> 01:40:49,020
[LAUGHTER]
[笑声]

2329
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:49,520
OK.
好的。

2330
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:51,800
When in doubt, this is when you reload the page.
有疑问时，就是你重新加载页面的时候。

2331
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,010
[LAUGHTER]
[笑声]

2332
01:40:53,010 --> 01:40:53,510
All right.
好吧。

2333
01:40:53,510 --> 01:40:55,730
So now we're back to where we wanted to be.
所以现在我们回到了我们想要的地方。

2334
01:40:55,730 --> 01:40:58,220
But where can we now use these kinds of building blocks?
但是我们现在可以在哪里使用这些积木？

2335
01:40:58,220 --> 01:41:00,540
Like, we were doing such tiny little programs.
就像，我们正在做一些非常小的程序。

2336
01:41:00,540 --> 01:41:04,220
But even that we could turn into a whole game, I bet.
但我敢说，即使那样我们也可以把它变成一个完整的游戏。

2337
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:07,700
Could we get like one volunteer to come on up?
我们可以找一位志愿者上来吗？

2338
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:08,810
One volunteer?
一位志愿者？

2339
01:41:08,810 --> 01:41:10,170
Everyone's looking down.
大家都低着头看。

2340
01:41:10,170 --> 01:41:10,670

01:41:18,650 --> 01:41:19,400
All right.
好吧。

2348
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:22,020
These Super Mario cookies are on the line for you,
这些超级马里奥饼干就取决于你的表现了，

2349
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:23,160
depending on how this goes.
这取决于结果如何。

2350
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:24,827
So I'm going to have you come over here.
所以我要让你到这边来。

2351
01:41:24,827 --> 01:41:28,940
And in advance on Scratch's website, we have some pre-made games,
之前在 Scratch 网站上，我们已经有一些预制的遊戲，

2352
01:41:28,940 --> 01:41:32,930
one of them written by one of your predecessors, a former student,
其中一个是由你之前的一位学生编写，

2353
01:41:32,930 --> 01:41:36,050
that they implemented this sort of "Whac-A-Mole" game.
他们实现了类似“打地鼠”的游戏。

2354
01:41:36,050 --> 01:41:39,290
So what you're about to see is the camera turn on on you.
所以你马上就会看到摄像头对准你。

2355
01:41:39,290 --> 01:41:43,160
And you're going to see four moles above, below, left, and right.
你会看到四个地鼠，分别在上面、下面、左边和右边。

2356
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:44,720
And using only your head--
只需要用你的头——

2357
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:47,930
up, down, left, right-- the goal is to whack a mole
上下左右——目标是打地鼠

2358
01:41:47,930 --> 01:41:51,860
to get a point every time your head touches one of these sprites.
每次你的头碰到这些精灵时，你就能获得一分。

2359
01:41:51,860 --> 01:41:54,740
So you're about to see things get very interesting very quickly.
所以你马上就会看到事情变得非常有趣，而且速度很快。

2360
01:41:54,740 --> 01:41:57,050
But using these building blocks, just those simple

blocks but have four sprites, not four cats but four moles in this case.
积木，但有四个精灵，不是四只猫，而是四个地鼠。

2366
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:08,900

[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]
[掌声，欢呼声]

2391
01:43:01,393 --> 01:43:04,210
DAVID J. MALAN: So we won't look at the code for that actual game.
大卫·马兰：所以我们不会查看那个实际游戏的代码。

2392
01:43:04,210 --> 01:43:05,740
It was written by one of your predecessors.
它是你的前辈写的。

2393
01:43:05,740 --> 01:43:07,573
And you can see it online if you're curious.
如果你好奇的话，你可以在网上看到它。

2394
01:43:07,573 --> 01:43:10,780
But you can think about now with our functions, conditionals,
但现在你可以考虑使用我们的函数、条件语句，

2395
01:43:10,780 --> 01:43:15,010
Boolean expressions, loops how you could kind of compose that kind of program.
布尔表达式、循环，你如何组合出这样的程序。

2396
01:43:15,010 --> 01:43:17,770
So odds are there was a loop that was just constantly listening
所以很可能有一个循环，它一直在监听

2397
01:43:17,770 --> 01:43:19,690
for that kind of connectivity, or it was one
这种连接，或者它是一个

2398
01:43:19,690 --> 01:43:22,900
of those extensions that was waiting for motion to go
那些等待运动去

2399
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:24,180
touch one of those sprites.
触碰其中一个精灵。

2400
01:43:24,180 --> 01:43:25,930
Notice that there's these numbers up here.
注意，这里有一些数字。

2401
01:43:25,930 --> 01:43:27,040
And we haven't talked about this yet.
我们还没有讨论过这个。

2402
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:30,040
But just like in math, where you can have variables x, y, and z,
但在编程中，你可以使用其他拼图块创建变量

2403
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:33,220
in programming, you can create variables using other puzzle pieces
就像在数学中，你可以有变量 x、y 和 z 一样，

2404
01:43:33,220 --> 01:43:36,460
in Scratch that just keep track of how many seconds are left,
在 Scratch 中，这些变量可以跟踪还剩多少秒，

2405
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:40,310
that keeps track of how many times her head hit one of the moles.
它可以跟踪她的头击中了多少次地鼠。

2406
01:43:40,310 --> 01:43:43,760
And so you can implement the mechanics of games using very simple building
因此，你可以使用非常简单的积木来实现游戏的机制

2407
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:44,260
blocks.
块。

2408
01:43:44,260 --> 01:43:46,240
But how do you go about building something
但是如何构建一些

2409
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:48,600
that's more interesting and interactive like that?
更有趣、更具互动性的东西？

2410
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:50,760
Let me go ahead and bring up, for instance,
让我展示一下，比如，

2411
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:52,930
one of the very first things I wrote years ago
几年前我写的最早的东西之一

2412
01:43:52,930 --> 01:43:55,430
when I was in graduate school and Scratch had just come out.
那是在我读研究生的时候，Scratch 刚发布。

2413
01:43:55,430 --> 01:43:57,380
I was taking a class at MIT's Media Lab.
我在麻省理工学院媒体实验室上了一门课。

2414
01:43:57,380 --> 01:44:01,520
And they invited us to beta test-- that is, try out the software before it then
他们邀请我们进行 Beta 测试，也就是在软件发布之前试用它。

2415
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:03,140
became part of the world.
成为世界的一部分。

2416
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:07,200
And the game I made was this one here.
我做的游戏就是这个。

2417
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:10,640
Let me find the right version of "Oscartime."
让我找到正确的“奥斯卡时间”版本。

2418
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:15,673
So "Oscartime" is a game that took me tens of hours probably in the end.
所以，“奥斯卡时间”这个游戏，可能最终花了我几十个小时。

2419
01:44:15,673 --> 01:44:18,590
It was a little bit addictive, but let me go ahead and full-screen it.
它有点上瘾，但是让我全屏播放它。

2420
01:44:18,590 --> 01:44:20,270
And I won't play the whole game.
我不会玩完整的游戏。

2421
01:44:20,270 --> 01:44:23,995
But it looked a little something like this.
但它看起来有点像这样。

2422
01:44:23,995 --> 01:44:25,120
OSCAR: (SINGS) Oh, I love--
奥斯卡：(唱歌)哦，我爱——

2423
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:28,220
DAVID J. MALAN: Where trash is falling from the sky.
大卫·马兰：垃圾从天空中掉下来。

2424
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:30,070
And I can click on it and drag it.

2425
01:44:30,070 --> 01:44:33,430
And notice as I get close, the lid opens up like this.
注意，当我靠近时，盖子像这样打开。

2426
01:44:33,430 --> 01:44:37,450
And if I let it keep falling, it goes in, and Oscar gives me a point.
如果我让它继续落下，它就会进去，奥斯卡会给我一个分数。

2427
01:44:37,450 --> 01:44:39,585
And I can do this again.
我还可以再做一次。

2428
01:44:39,585 --> 01:44:41,710
OSCAR: If you really want to see something trashy--
奥斯卡：如果你真的想看看一些垃圾——

2429
01:44:41,710 --> 01:44:41,860
DAVID J. MALAN: All right.
大卫·J·马兰：好的。

2430
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:42,943
Here comes something else.
来了点其他的东西。

2431
01:44:42,943 --> 01:44:44,565
OSCAR: I have here a sneaker that--
奥斯卡：我这里有一双运动鞋，它——

2432
01:44:44,565 --> 01:44:46,690
DAVID J. MALAN: So now there's two pieces of trash.
大卫·J·马兰：所以现在有两件垃圾了。

2433
01:44:46,690 --> 01:44:49,787
OSCAR: It's all full of holes, and the laces are--
奥斯卡：它到处都是洞，鞋带是——

2434
01:44:49,787 --> 01:44:52,370
DAVID J. MALAN: And it just keeps going, and going, and going.
大卫·J·马兰：它一直在不断落下，落下，落下。

2435
01:44:52,370 --> 01:44:55,537
And if we can lower the volume for just a moment, we'll let more trash fall.
如果我们能把音量调低一点，我们就会让更多垃圾落下。

2436
01:44:55,537 --> 01:44:58,300
But to your comment earlier about one sprite or more
但是你之前提到的一个精灵或者更多精灵，这就是我们在这里看到的情况。

2437
01:44:58,300 --> 01:45:00,040
sprites, that's what we're seeing here.
精灵，这就是我们在这里看到的情况。

2438
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:03,190
Even though our examples thus far are just one cat, one or two puzzle
虽然到目前为止，我们的例子只有一个猫，一个或两个拼图

2439
01:45:03,190 --> 01:45:04,660
pieces, or a few puzzle pieces.
碎片，或者一些拼图碎片。

2440
01:45:04,660 --> 01:45:06,670
Here is, I claim, a sprite.
我声称，这是一个精灵。

2441
01:45:06,670 --> 01:45:08,110
Here is another sprite.
这是另一个精灵。

2442
01:45:08,110 --> 01:45:09,340
Here is another sprite.
这是另一个精灵。

2443
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:11,950
And by toggling among them in that bottom right-hand corner,
通过在右下角切换它们，

2444
01:45:11,950 --> 01:45:15,460
I can just associate different puzzle pieces with each of these sprites.
我就可以将不同的拼图碎片与这些精灵关联起来。

2445
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:17,987
Now, I didn't start off by implementing this whole game.
现在，我一开始并没有实现整个游戏。

2446
01:45:17,987 --> 01:45:20,570
And in just a moment, if we can raise the volume a little bit,
稍等片刻，如果我们可以稍微提高音量，

2447
01:45:20,570 --> 01:45:22,400
we'll see even more trash is falling.
我们会看到更多垃圾正在落下。

2448
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:23,300
So this is what--

2449
01:45:23,300 --> 01:45:26,930
I hate this song now, like 10 plus hours listening to this song on loop
我现在讨厌这首歌，就像循环播放这首歌超过10个小时

2450
01:45:26,930 --> 01:45:28,160
just to get the timing right.
只是为了让时间安排得当。

2451
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:31,040
But it brings to life all of these different sprites.
但它让所有这些不同的精灵都活跃了起来。

2452
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:34,130
And if you play it again and again, it's always a little bit different
如果你反复播放它，它总是有一点不同

2453
01:45:34,130 --> 01:45:35,600
because I'm using some randomness.

2454
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:38,510
So this newspaper doesn't always fall from there.

2455
01:45:38,510 --> 01:45:39,650
Sometimes it's here.

Sometimes it's here.

things are being perturbed a little, randomized a little bit

It just goes on forever, this kind of game.

2471

01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:11,090
let me open a few of these versions here-- that the very first thing I did

I was kind of procrastinating, so I poked around.

Version one is done.

Then I started thinking about, all right,

how do I bring the trash to life, even if it doesn't do much of anything else?
即使它什么也做不了，我该如何让垃圾活起来？

in that bottom right-hand corner.

01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:07,130
Well, let me click on Oscar down there, my first sprite.
好吧，让我点击下面的奥斯卡，我的第一个精灵。

2547
01:47:07,130 --> 01:47:10,580
And here are the puzzle pieces via which I implemented this idea.
这里就是我用来实现这个想法的拼图碎片。

2548
01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:13,340
I changed Oscar's costume, his appearance,
我改变了奥斯卡的服装，他的外貌，

2549
01:47:13,340 --> 01:47:17,960
to be just number one, which was one of the images I imported into the program.
只是变成了数字1，这是我导入程序中的其中一张图片。

2550
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:19,820
And then I forever did this.
然后我永远地做了这件事。

2551
01:47:19,820 --> 01:47:22,460
If Oscar is touching the mouse pointer, then
如果奥斯卡碰到了鼠标指针，那么

2552
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:26,390
change Oscar's costume to number two, otherwise change it back to one.
将奥斯卡的服装改为数字2，否则将其改回数字1。

2553
01:47:26,390 --> 01:47:28,190
So it's super simple animation.
所以这是一个超级简单的动画。

2554
01:47:28,190 --> 01:47:31,970
I'm just toggling between lid up, lid down, lid up, lid down,
我只是在盖子打开、盖子关闭、盖子打开、盖子关闭之间切换，

2555
01:47:31,970 --> 01:47:33,710
but it kind of feels interactive.
但这感觉起来有点互动。

2556
01:47:33,710 --> 01:47:35,810
And if I wanted to really make this pretty,
如果我想让它更漂亮，

2557
01:47:35,810 --> 01:47:40,580
I could have 30 different costumes where the lid is ever so slightly higher.
我可以制作30套不同的服装，让盖子稍微高一点。

2558
01:47:40,580 --> 01:47:44,120
Then it would look even more like a movie or fluid motion.
然后它看起来更像电影或流畅的动作。

2559
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:46,640
But this was enough to get the job done, which
但这已经足够完成任务了，也就是说

2560
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:49,700
is to say I didn't try to implement all of "Oscartime" together.
我没有尝试将所有“奥斯卡时间”都放在一起实现。

2561
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:52,490
I just took a second baby step toward my goal.
我只是朝着我的目标迈出了第二步。

2562
01:47:52,490 --> 01:47:54,950
And then my next version of "Oscartime" might
然后我的下一个“奥斯卡时间”版本可能

2563
01:47:54,950 --> 01:47:57,675
have looked a little something like this, where now the trash--
看起来有点像这样，现在垃圾——

2564
01:47:57,675 --> 01:47:58,800
there's more going on here.
这里发生了更多的事情。

2565
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:02,300
Let's look at two of these blocks of code.
让我们看看这两块代码。

2566
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:04,972
The first thing I did was I enabled drag mode to draggable,
我做的第一件事是，我将拖动模式设置为可拖动，

2567
01:48:04,972 --> 01:48:07,430
and I had to Google to figure this out because otherwise it
我不得不谷歌搜索来弄清楚这一点，因为否则它

2568
01:48:07,430 --> 01:48:09,890
didn't let me drag the trash while playing the game.
不允许我在玩游戏时拖动垃圾。

2569
01:48:09,890 --> 01:48:12,800
But once I figured that out, I tell the trash
但一旦我弄明白了，我就告诉垃圾

2570
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:16,700
to go to a random x-coordinate between 0 and 240
移动到 0 到 240 之间的随机 x 坐标

2571
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:19,670
from left to right and then the y location 180
从左到右，然后是 y 位置 180

2572
01:48:19,670 --> 01:48:22,070
because I always want the trash falling from the sky.
因为我总是希望垃圾从天空中掉下来。

2523
01:48:22,070 --> 01:48:23,270
And then what do I do?
然后我该怎么做呢？

2524
01:48:23,270 --> 01:48:27,530
I told the trash to forever change its y-coordinate, its vertical coordinate,
我告诉垃圾永远改变它的 y 坐标，也就是垂直坐标，

2525
01:48:27,530 --> 01:48:30,740
by negative 1, negative 1, negative 1, one pixel
每次下降 1 像素， 1 像素， 1 像素

2526
01:48:30,740 --> 01:48:34,190
at a time, which creates the illusion of it falling from the sky.
这样就能营造出垃圾从天而降的错觉。

2527
01:48:34,190 --> 01:48:36,950
But I needed to do one other thing, and let me scroll up.
但我还需要做另外一件事，让我向上滚动一下。

2528
01:48:36,950 --> 01:48:41,360
Each of your sprites can have multiple programs, multiple scripts,
每个精灵都可以拥有多个程序，多个脚本，

2529
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:44,070
so to speak, that are not attached to one another.
可以这么说，这些脚本彼此之间并不相关。

2530
01:48:44,070 --> 01:48:46,050
They will happen in parallel for you.
它们会同时运行。

2531
01:48:46,050 --> 01:48:47,750
The second one is saying this.
第二个脚本是这么写的。

2532
01:48:47,750 --> 01:48:52,850
Forever if the trash is touching Oscar, what should it do?
永远，如果垃圾触碰了奥斯卡，它应该怎么做呢？

2533
01:48:52,850 --> 01:48:57,440
Go to a completely different x and y location at the very top.
转移到最上面的一个完全不同的 x 和 y 位置。

2534
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:57,950
Why?
为什么？

2535
01:48:57,950 --> 01:49:01,010
Well, as soon as I drag the trash over the Oscar,
只要我把垃圾拖到奥斯卡上面，

2536
01:49:01,010 --> 01:49:03,530
I want it to disappear as though it's going into the can.
我就希望它消失，就像被扔进了垃圾桶一样。

2537
01:49:03,530 --> 01:49:06,830
And I then want it to reappear at the top so more trash falls.
然后我想要它重新出现在顶部，这样就又会有新的垃圾掉下来了。

2538
01:49:06,830 --> 01:49:08,840
So I just thought about what would it mean
所以我只是思考了，对于垃圾来说，被扔进垃圾桶意味着什么？

2539
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:10,910
for the trash to go into the trash can.
对于垃圾来说，被扔进垃圾桶意味着什么？

2540
01:49:10,910 --> 01:49:11,870
Well, who cares?
好吧，谁在乎呢？

2541
01:49:11,870 --> 01:49:14,210
What really matters to the human user is that it just
对于人类用户来说，真正重要的是它只是

2542
01:49:14,210 --> 01:49:16,980
disappears and teleports elsewhere.
消失，然后传送到了别的地方。

2543
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:19,620
And so that's the idea I implemented here.
这就是我在这里实现的想法。

2544
01:49:19,620 --> 01:49:24,960
So if you can reduce intuitive ideas to just basic building blocks like this,
所以，如果你能将直观的思想分解成像这样的基本构建块，

2545
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:27,440
you can start to make things much more interactive.
你就可以开始让事物变得更加互动。

2546
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:29,970
And lastly, if I look at this version here,
最后，如果我看看这里这个版本，

2547
01:49:29,970 --> 01:49:33,050
you'll see that we've combined these.
你会发现我们已经把这些都结合起来了。

2548
01:49:33,050 --> 01:49:35,930
And so indeed, if I actually go ahead and play this now,
所以，如果我现在真正去运行一下，

2549
01:49:35,930 --> 01:49:37,790
not only is it falling.
它不仅会掉下来。

2550
01:49:37,790 --> 01:49:41,090
I can let it fall right on top of Oscar and watch it disappear.
我可以让它直接掉到奥斯卡上面，然后看着它消失。

2551
01:49:41,090 --> 01:49:44,795
But notice Oscar doesn't pop out yet because that was the fourth version
但注意，奥斯卡还没弹出来，因为那是第四个版本

2552
01:49:44,795 --> 01:49:45,920
and then the fifth version.
然后是第五个版本。

2553
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:48,650
And then I added the annoying music and so forth but sort of
然后我加上了恼人的音乐等等，但是，某种程度上来说，

2554
01:49:48,650 --> 01:49:51,600
composed this program step by step by step
我是一步一步地编写了这个程序，

2555
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:53,193
so as to accomplish my larger goal.
以便实现我的最终目标。

2556
01:49:53,193 --> 01:49:55,610
And this is going to be true of all of the code you write,
而这对于你编写的任何代码来说都是一样的，

2557
01:49:55,610 --> 01:50:00,980
be it in Scratch, or C, or Python, or in the like, trying to come up with--
无论是用 Scratch、C 还是 Python 语言，或者其他任何语言，你都需要尝试着去想出——

2558
01:50:00,980 --> 01:50:05,360
or rather, trying to reduce your ideas, your grand vision to just baby steps,
或者说，尝试将你的想法、你的宏伟愿景分解成微不足道的步骤，

2559
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:07,670
building blocks so that you start with version one,
一个个基础模块，这样你就可以从版本一入手，

2560
01:50:07,670 --> 01:50:10,010
and maybe you submit version 10 or 20.
或许你最终会提交版本十或版本二十。

2561
01:50:10,010 --> 01:50:13,190
But you don't try to implement version 10 or 20 at the get-go.
但你不会一开始就尝试实现版本十或版本二十。

2562
01:50:13,190 --> 01:50:15,780
You take those incremental steps.
你应该一步步地前进。

2563
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:16,280
All right.
好的。

2564
01:50:16,280 --> 01:50:17,270
How about one other?
还有别的例子吗？

2565
01:50:17,270 --> 01:50:19,550
Well, let me propose this.
好吧，让我来提一个建议。

2566
01:50:19,550 --> 01:50:23,370
Let me go ahead and open three games that represent one
让我打开三个游戏，它们分别代表着

2567
01:50:23,370 --> 01:50:27,570
that your predecessors also implemented, which looks a little something
你们的前辈们也实现过，它看起来有点像

2568
01:50:27,570 --> 01:50:29,220
like this in version zero.
版本零的样子。

2569
01:50:29,220 --> 01:50:32,220
Suppose I wanted to implement a game that
假设我想要实现一个游戏，它

2570
01:50:32,220 --> 01:50:33,900
simply has these kinds of mechanics.
只包含了这些类型的机制。

2571
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:37,050
I'm touching my arrow keys on my keyboard-- up, down, left, and right.
我在键盘上按着方向键——上，下，左，右。

2572
01:50:37,050 --> 01:50:38,460
And I'm moving the Harvard logo.
而我在移动哈佛的校徽。

2573
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:39,610
Let me zoom in a bit.
让我稍微放大一点。

2574
01:50:39,610 --> 01:50:42,210
So if I hit the up arrow, the Harvard shield goes up.
所以，如果我按向上箭头，哈佛的盾牌就会向上移动。

2575
01:50:42,210 --> 01:50:44,760
If I hit the down arrow, the shield goes down.
如果我按向下箭头，盾牌就会向下移动。

2576
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:47,070
If I go all the way to the left, it goes left
如果我一直向左移动，它就会向左移动

2577
01:50:47,070 --> 01:50:49,548
until it hits the wall and same thing on the right.
直到撞到墙壁，右侧也是一样。

2578
01:50:49,548 --> 01:50:51,840
So this is like the beginnings of a game or a beginning
所以，这就像是一个游戏的开端，或者是一个迷宫的开端，类似于这种。

2579
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:53,370
of a maze, something like that.
所以，这就像是一个游戏的开端，或者是一个迷宫的开端，类似于这种。

2580
01:50:53,370 --> 01:50:55,150
Well, how might I implement this?
那么，我该如何实现它呢？

2581
01:50:55,150 --> 01:50:57,210
Well, let me look inside this one.
好吧，让我来看看这个例子。

2582
01:50:57,210 --> 01:51:01,020
And there's a lot going on, but, again, I sort of took simple steps.
这里有很多东西，但再一次，我只是采取了一些简单的步骤。

2583
01:51:01,020 --> 01:51:02,730
Notice that I've got three sprites--
请注意，我使用了三个精灵——

2584
01:51:02,730 --> 01:51:04,920
a left wall, which is just a straight line,
左边的墙，只是一条直线，

2585
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:07,140
the right wall, which is a straight line.
右边的墙，也是一条直线。

2586
01:51:07,140 --> 01:51:10,710
And just intuitively, why did I implement those as sprites?
直观地来说，为什么我要把它们实现成精灵呢？

2587
01:51:10,710 --> 01:51:15,240
Why do they need to exist as entities themselves?
为什么它们需要作为独立的实体存在？

2588
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:16,230
Yeah, in front.
是的，在前面。

2589
01:51:16,230 --> 01:51:16,530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
观众：[听不清]

2590
01:51:16,530 --> 01:51:17,405
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah.
大卫·马兰：是的。

2591
01:51:17,405 --> 01:51:19,033
I want it to interact with the shield.
我想让它与盾牌进行交互。

2592
01:51:19,033 --> 01:51:21,450
So I need to be able to ask that Boolean expression, like,
所以，我需要能够提出这样的布尔表达式，比如：

2593
01:51:21,450 --> 01:51:24,940
not touching mouse pointer but touching shield, for instance,
不触碰鼠标指针，但触碰了盾牌，比如这样。

2594
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:26,560
a different type of yes/no question.
这是一个不同的真假判断问题。

2595
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:29,130
And so what is the code for the shield actually doing?
那么，盾牌的代码实际上在做什么呢？

2596
01:51:29,130 --> 01:51:32,850
Well, there's a lot of duplication, and let me focus on the abstraction first.
好吧，这里有很多重复的部分，让我先关注一下抽象部分。

2597
01:51:32,850 --> 01:51:35,680
Notice that I've got this one green flag clicked.
请注意，我这里有一个绿色旗帜被点击了。

2598
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:38,430
I want the shield to go dead center, 0 comma 0,
我希望盾牌位于正中央，也就是 0, 0 这个位置，

2599
01:51:38,430 --> 01:51:42,600
and then forever listen for the human's keyboard, and feel for the wall.
然后它会一直监听用户的键盘，并感知墙壁。

2600
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:45,815
So I decided to implement my own pink puzzle pieces that
所以我决定实现我自己的粉色拼图块，这些拼图块

2601
01:51:45,815 --> 01:51:47,190
implement the two separate ideas.
实现了两个独立的想法。

2602
01:51:47,190 --> 01:51:49,450
One, just listen for the keyboard-- up, down, left,
第一个，就是监听键盘——上，下，左，

2603
01:51:49,450 --> 01:51:50,700
right-- and then do something.
右——然后执行相应的操作。

2604
01:51:50,700 --> 01:51:53,770
And then feel for walls is this idea of whenever I go up,
然后是感知墙壁，这个想法就是，无论何时我向上移动，

2605
01:51:53,770 --> 01:51:56,550
down, left, or right, if I touch a wall, I
向下移动，向左移动，或向右移动，如果我碰到了墙壁，我

2606
01:51:56,550 --> 01:52:00,600
need to stop doing whatever the keystrokes are telling me to do.
需要停止执行键盘输入告诉我要做的事情。

2607
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:05,580
So now if we dive into those implementation details, listen and feel
所以，现在让我们深入这些实现细节，监听和感知

2608
01:52:05,580 --> 01:52:07,930
are abstractions, custom puzzle pieces.
是抽象的，定制的拼图块。

2609
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:09,870
Let's look at the implementation details.
让我们来看看实现细节。

2610
01:52:09,870 --> 01:52:11,220
Well, here's the keyboard.
好了，这里就是键盘。

2611
01:52:11,220 --> 01:52:15,840
If the key arrow up is pressed, change y by 1.
如果按下向上箭头键，则将 y 坐标加 1。

2612
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:19,495
If key down arrow is pressed, change y by negative 1.
如果按下向下箭头键，则将 y 坐标减 1。

2613
01:52:19,495 --> 01:52:21,370
And you can probably see where this is going.
你可能已经猜到了接下来的代码会是什么了。

2614
01:52:21,370 --> 01:52:23,310
Right arrow is x by 1.
右箭头是 x 坐标加 1。

2615
01:52:23,310 --> 01:52:25,920
Left arrow is x by negative 1, and that's
左箭头是 x 坐标减 1，而这就是

2616
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:29,050
sort of all that's involved with up, down, left, right.
所有关于上，下，左，右的操作了。

2617
01:52:29,050 --> 01:52:30,030
But wait a minute.
等等。

2618
01:52:30,030 --> 01:52:35,910
Why is there no loop in this listen for keyboard puzzle piece?
为什么在这个监听键盘的拼图块里没有循环呢？

2619
01:52:35,910 --> 01:52:39,240
I needed a loop last time so it constantly works.
上一次我需要循环，才能让它不断地执行。

2620
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:40,770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
观众：[听不清]

2621
01:52:40,770 --> 01:52:41,770
DAVID J. MALAN: Exactly.
大卫·J·马兰：没错。

2622
01:52:41,770 --> 01:52:44,350
I put the loop in my main part of my program
我把循环放在程序的主体部分

2623
01:52:44,350 --> 01:52:48,020
up top so something is telling me to keep listening again and again.
最上面，这样就有人不断地告诉我继续监听。

2624
01:52:48,020 --> 01:52:50,020
So it's got to be somewhere, but it doesn't have
所以它必须存在于某个地方，但它并不需要

2625
01:52:50,020 --> 01:52:51,760
to be in the actual implementation.
存在于实际的实现中。

2626
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,950
And lastly, how about this feel for walls?
最后，我们来谈谈这种墙壁的感觉？

2627
01:52:53,950 --> 01:52:58,420
Well, if touching left wall, which is just another sprite, change x by 1.
嗯，如果碰到左边的墙壁，它只是一个精灵，就把x值改变1。

2628
01:52:58,420 --> 01:53:00,880
So that is to say if I'm touching the left wall,
也就是说，如果我碰到了左边的墙壁，

2629
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:03,465
I want to bounce it back the other direction
我想让它弹回来，往另一个方向

2630
01:53:03,465 --> 01:53:04,840
and same thing on the right wall.
在右边的墙壁上也是一样。

2631
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:06,580
If I'm touching the right wall, I want to bounce it
如果我碰到了右边的墙壁，我想让它弹回来

2632
01:53:06,580 --> 01:53:09,670
back to the left, which effectively means that even if the human's hitting
回到左边，这实际上意味着，即使人类在按

2633
01:53:09,670 --> 01:53:11,680
the key, it's like fighting with this code,
按键，它就像与这段代码作斗争，

2634
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:14,890
but it's never going to go through the wall based on that math.
但根据这个数学公式，它永远不会穿透墙壁。

2635
01:53:14,890 --> 01:53:16,760
It's going to stop it right there.
它会把它停在那里。

2636
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:17,260
All right.
好的。

2637
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:18,760
Let's add something else to the mix.
让我们再加点东西。

2638
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:21,640
Suppose I want the game to change to be a little something like this,
假设我想让游戏变得有点像这样，

2639
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:25,300
where Yale is some kind of block in between me and the exit.
耶鲁大学的标志就像是我和出口之间的障碍物。

2640
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:27,140
So some dramatic race here.
所以这里有一些戏剧性的比赛。

2641
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:27,640
OK.
好的。

2642
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:30,100
I just got by, but the Yale logo doesn't seem
我刚刚过去，但耶鲁大学的标志看起来

2643
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:32,200
to be doing all that much except bouncing.
除了弹跳之外，并没有做太多的事情。

2644
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:35,660
So I'm guessing there's a loop, maybe a conditional checking for those walls
所以我想也许有一个循环，也许有一个条件语句来检查那些墙壁

2645
01:53:35,660 --> 01:53:36,160
too.
也是。

2646
01:53:36,160 --> 01:53:38,823
So let's go ahead and zoom out, see inside.
所以让我们先放大，看看里面。

2647
01:53:38,823 --> 01:53:41,490
Let's not worry about Harvard because it's pretty much the same.
我们先别管哈佛大学，因为它基本是一样的。

2648
01:53:41,490 --> 01:53:43,520
Let's look at the Yale puzzle pieces.
我们来看看耶鲁大学的拼图碎片。

2649
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:45,710
And sure enough, go to the middle.
当然，来到中间。

2650
01:53:45,710 --> 01:53:46,880
0 comma zero.
0,0。

2651
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:50,930
Point in direction 90, so point horizontally on the grid.
指向90度方向，所以水平地指向网格。

2652
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:53,870
And then if touching left wall or touching right wall--
然后，如果碰到左边的墙壁或者右边的墙壁，

2653
01:53:53,870 --> 01:53:58,470
I'm kind of cheating this time, but cleverly, just spin around and do 180
这次我有点作弊，但很巧妙，只需旋转并进行180度旋转

2654
01:53:58,470 --> 01:54:00,198
so you effectively bounce off the wall.
这样你就可以有效地反弹墙壁。

2655
01:54:00,198 --> 01:54:01,490
This just tightened up my code.
这只是让我的代码更紧凑。

2656
01:54:01,490 --> 01:54:03,490
I don't need to do the negative 1 or the plus 1.
我不需要做减1或加1。

2657
01:54:03,490 --> 01:54:07,010
I just say bounce in this form of code, otherwise just
我只需要用这种代码形式说反弹，否则就

2658
01:54:07,010 --> 01:54:08,420
constantly move one step.
不断地移动一步。

2659
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:12,080
Now, if this is a game where Yale is supposed to be better and faster,
现在，如果这是一款耶鲁大学的标志应该更快更强的游戏，

2660
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:13,520
well, let's change the 1 to 5.
好吧，让我们把1改为5。

2661
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:15,300
Move 5 pixels at a time.
每次移动5个像素。

2662
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:17,610
Let's move it 10 back and forth.
让我们让它来回移动10个像素。

2663
01:54:17,610 --> 01:54:19,040
Let's maybe 100.
我们试着移动100个像素吧。

2664
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:20,150
Uh-oh.
哦，糟糕。

2665
01:54:20,150 --> 01:54:21,380
So what just happened?
所以，刚刚发生了什么？

2666
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:25,310
That is a bug, which we can avoid by just not doing that.
这是一个错误，我们可以通过不做这件事来避免。

2667
01:54:25,310 --> 01:54:27,310
But why did it break out of the wall?
但为什么它会穿透墙壁？

2668
01:54:27,310 --> 01:54:28,310
Yeah.
没错。

2669
01:54:28,310 --> 01:54:29,600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
观众：[听不清]。

2670
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:30,890
At first it was [INAUDIBLE].
一开始它是[听不清]。

2671
01:54:30,890 --> 01:54:31,890
DAVID J. MALAN: Exactly.
大卫·J·马兰：没错。

2672
01:54:31,890 --> 01:54:34,010
Because I'm doing 100 steps at a time, I'm
因为我一次移动100步，我

2673
01:54:34,010 --> 01:54:36,200
never actually touching the other sprite because I'm
从来没有真正碰到另一个精灵，因为我

2674
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:38,060
sort of stepping way over it.
有点跨过它了。

2675
01:54:38,060 --> 01:54:40,610
So there's never a moment where they're actually touching.
所以，它们实际上从来没有接触过。

2676
01:54:40,610 --> 01:54:44,630
So previously, I was just getting lucky by doing fewer steps because it's
所以之前，我只是一直很幸运，因为我移动的步数比较少，所以它

2677
01:54:44,630 --> 01:54:46,700
gradually going over the wall, which gives me
慢慢地越过墙壁，这给了我

2678
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:48,557
just enough time to detect as much.
足够的时间来检测它。

2679
01:54:48,557 --> 01:54:50,390
So I would have to kind of tinker, and he'll
所以我会进行一些调整，他会

2680
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:51,932
handle this a little bit differently.
以稍微不同的方式来处理这件事。

2681
01:54:51,932 --> 01:54:53,790
So it's a bug if it's too fast.
所以如果它太快了，那就是一个错误。

2682
01:54:53,790 --> 01:54:55,730
But at least if I keep it slow and reasonable
但至少如果我保持它缓慢而合理，

2683
01:54:55,730 --> 01:54:59,870
the math actually does work out, so long as it starts again in the middle.
数学实际上是有效的，只要它从中间重新开始。

2684
01:54:59,870 --> 01:55:04,200
Well, let's do one final flourish here, whereby let's bring MIT into the mix.
好吧，让我们在这里做最后的一点润色，让我们把麻省理工学院也加入进来。

2685
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:04,700
Right?
对吧？

2686
01:55:04,700 --> 01:55:06,770
They're super smart, so maybe they can kind of
他们超级聪明，所以也许他们可以

2687
01:55:06,770 --> 01:55:11,390
track us and follow wherever I'm going.
跟踪我们，并跟随我走到哪里。

2688
01:55:11,390 --> 01:55:13,140
So how might this work?
所以，这可能怎么实现呢？

2689
01:55:13,140 --> 01:55:13,640
All right.
好的。

2690
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:16,580
So nothing happens yet because we haven't finished composing the game.
所以现在还没有发生任何事，因为我们还没有完成游戏的制作。

2691
01:55:16,580 --> 01:55:17,490
And notice here--
请注意这里

2692
01:55:17,490 --> 01:55:17,990
OK.
好的。

2693
01:55:17,990 --> 01:55:19,063
Now MIT is struggling.
现在麻省理工学院正在挣扎。

2694
01:55:19,063 --> 01:55:21,980
It's kind of twitching there because it's going just above, and below,
它有点抽搐，因为它在上面和下面移动，

2695
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:23,100
and then above, and below.
然后又在上面和下面移动。

2696
01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:24,840
So we could fix that too if we want.
所以如果我们想的话，我们可以修复它。

2697
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:28,080
But that's just a function of my math, one pixel at a time.
但这只是我的数学公式的结果，每次移动一个像素。

2698
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:33,570
Let me open up this one, see inside, and click on MIT.
让我打开这个，看看里面，然后点击麻省理工学院。

2699
01:55:33,570 --> 01:55:37,110
And it doesn't take much to implement MIT, it seems.
看起来，实现麻省理工学院并不需要太多。

2700
01:55:37,110 --> 01:55:43,200
So go to random position, forever point towards the Harvard logo outline,
所以，随机移动到某个位置，永远指向哈佛大学的标志轮廓，

2701
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:46,330
AKA the shield, and then move one step.
也就是盾牌，然后移动一步。

2702
01:55:46,330 --> 01:55:50,705
So if I wanted to make MIT even smarter, even faster, what do I change here?
所以如果我想让麻省理工学院更聪明，更快，我应该在这里改变什么？

2703
01:55:50,705 --> 01:55:51,580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
观众：[听不清]

2704
01:55:51,580 --> 01:55:52,455
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah.
大卫·J·马兰：没错。

2705
01:55:52,455 --> 01:55:56,070
Change one step to two steps to double their speed or five steps, 10 steps,
把一步改为两步，让它们的速度翻倍，或者五步，十步，

2706
01:55:56,070 --> 01:55:56,612
or 100 steps.
或者一百步。

2707
01:55:56,612 --> 01:55:58,403
And the game is going to be over like that.
这样游戏就会很快结束。

2708
01:55:58,403 --> 01:56:00,940
But that's all it takes to now make these kinds of elements.
但这就是现在制作这些元素所需要的全部。

2709
01:56:00,940 --> 01:56:03,330
So if you are a game player on your phone, or consoles,
所以，如果你是在手机上，或者在游戏机上，

2710
01:56:03,330 --> 01:56:06,120
or computer, or whatever, if you think about almost any game,
或者电脑上，或者其他什么地方，如果你想想几乎所有的游戏，

2711
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:08,910
you can probably now start to think about how they implemented
你可能现在可以开始思考他们是如何实现

2712
01:56:08,910 --> 01:56:12,210
those mechanics because it's just being reduced to functions, conditionals,
这些机制的，因为它们只是被简化为函数，条件语句，

2713
01:56:12,210 --> 01:56:15,640
loops, variables, and the like in this case.
循环，变量，以及在这种情况下类似的东西。

2714
01:56:15,640 --> 01:56:20,560
So let's go ahead here and have maybe one final volunteer.
所以让我们继续，再来一个志愿者。

2715
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:22,480
We've got one more bag of Oreos here.
我们还有一包奥利奥饼干。

2716
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:22,980
OK.
好的。

2717
01:56:22,980 --> 01:56:23,640
That was super fast.
太快了。

2718
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:24,750
Do you want to come on up?
你想上来吗？

2719
01:56:24,750 --> 01:56:25,250
All right.
好的。

2720
01:56:25,250 --> 01:56:25,920
Brave volunteer.
勇敢的志愿者。

2721
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:26,820
Come on up.
上来吧。

2722

[APPLAUSE]
[掌声]

2723
01:56:31,180 --> 01:56:31,680
All right.
好的。

2724
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:36,720
Let me find the full-fledged version of this that one of your predecessors
让我找到这个游戏的完整版本，这个版本是由你的前任之一

2725
01:56:36,720 --> 01:56:37,650
made.
制作的。

2726
01:56:37,650 --> 01:56:40,490
And let me get the right one.
让我找到正确的那个。

2727
01:56:40,490 --> 01:56:40,990
OK.
好的。

2728
01:56:40,990 --> 01:56:41,740
Here we go.
我们开始了。

2729
01:56:41,740 --> 01:56:45,030
We'll see some instructions on the screen in just a moment.
过一会儿你会看到屏幕上的说明。

2730
01:56:45,030 --> 01:56:50,460
And when we hit Play, you'll see that the mechanics are all combined now
当我们点击播放时，你会看到所有机制现在都组合在一起了

2731
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:51,630
into one full-fledged game.
成为一个完整的游戏。

2732
01:56:51,630 --> 01:56:54,740
But first, an introduction.
