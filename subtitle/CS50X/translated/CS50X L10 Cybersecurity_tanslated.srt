into a recreation of R2-D2.

00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,743
I'm not sure if we actually stood there with a sign holding duck,
我不确定我们是否真的在那里拿着写着“鸭子”的牌子站着，

00:07:29,743 --> 00:07:32,160
but it turns out they came actually earlier in the morning
但事实证明，他们实际上是在早上早些时候来的

136
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,240
And here the duck is again today.

176
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,600
but with all of this now software support by your side.
但现在有了这些软件支持，在你身边。

177
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,590
This here is our very own CS50 shuttles that will take us then to IHOP.
这是我们自己的 CS50 班车，会把我们送到 IHOP。

178
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,770
And then a week after that is the epic CS50
然后在一周后，就是史诗般的 CS50

179
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,650

展会，将是一个展示你将在接下来的几周内完成的作品的机会，面向学生、教师和

180
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,630
pull off over the next few weeks to students, faculty,
面向学生、教师和

181
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,940
and staff across campus.
校园里的工作人员。

182
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,820
More details to come, but you'll bring over your laptop or phone
更多细节待公布，但你需要带你的笔记本电脑或手机

183
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,170
to a large space on campus.

我们将邀请你所有的朋友，甚至你的家人，如果他们就在附近。

185
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,330
And the goal will be simply to have chats like this

00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,640
and present your final project to passersby.
然后向路人展示你们的最终项目。

187
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,950
There'll be a bit of an incentive model, whereby
我们还将设置一个激励机制，

188
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,050
anyone who chats you up about their project,
任何和你聊他们项目的人，

189
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,490
you can give a little sticker to.
你都可以给一个小贴纸。

190
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,220
And that will enter them into a raffle for fabulous prizes
这将使他们有机会参加抽奖，赢得丰厚的奖品

191
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,630
to grease the wheels of conversations as well.
来推动对话的进行。

192
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,740
And you'll see faculty from across campus join us as well.
你还会看到来自校园各地的教职工也加入我们。

193
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,510
But ultimately, you walk out of that event with this here CS50 shirt,
但最终，你离开活动时会得到这件CS50 T恤，

194
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:23,250
one like it, so you too, can proudly proclaim that you indeed took CS50.
和它一样的，这样你也可以自豪地宣称你确实上了CS50。

195
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,160
So all that and more to come, resting on finally, those final projects.
所以这一切，以及更多，都将建立在最终的项目上。

196
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,035
But how to get there.
但如何才能做到呢？

197
00:10:28,035 --> 00:10:30,535
So here are some general advice that's not necessarily going
以下是一些通用的建议，它们不一定会适用于所有最终项目。

198
00:10:30,535 --> 00:10:32,190
to be applicable to all final projects.
但随着我们走出CS50，进入现实世界，

199
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,140
But as we exit CS50 and enter the real world,
以下是一些关于你可能阅读、下载的内容的建议，

200
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,460
here are some tips on what you might read, what you might download,
一些起点，这样你就能回答常见问题，即“现在怎么办？”

201
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,730
sort of starting points so that in answer to the FAQ, what now?
例如，如果你想在自己的Mac或PC上体验

202
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,030
So for instance, if you would like to begin
更多使用cs50.dev提供的云端编程环境，

203
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:49,020
to experience on your own Mac or PC more of the programming environment
你可以安装一些命令行工具到你的笔记本电脑、台式机上，

204
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:53,670
that we provided to you, sort of turnkey style in the cloud using cs50.dev,
或者类似的设备。

205
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:57,790
you can actually install command line tools on your own laptop, desktop,
例如，苹果有他们自己的。

206
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,320
or the like.
Windows也有他们自己的。

207
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,910
For instance, Apple has their own.
所以你可以在自己的电脑上打开一个终端窗口

208
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,900
Windows has their own.
并在其中执行你在Linux中使用过的许多命令。

209
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,150
So you can open a terminal window on your own computer
整个学期都是这样。

210
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,210
and execute much of the same commands that you've been doing in Linux
学习Git，Git是一种版本控制软件。

211
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,200
this whole term.
它在业界非常流行。

212
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,320
Learning Git, so Git is version control software.
它是一种保存文件多个版本的机制。

213
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,560
And it's very, very popular in industry.
现在，如果你还使用

214
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,882
And it's a mechanism for saving multiple versions of your files.
在你的Mac或PC上，甚至使用文件名，

215
00:11:16,882 --> 00:11:19,340
Now, this is something you might be familiar with if still,
你可能就熟悉这种机制了，比如简历版本1、简历版本2、

216
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,060
even using file names in the real world, like on your Mac or PC--
周一晚上版本、周二版本，等等。

217
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,120
maybe this is resume version 1, resume version 2,
如果你使用的是谷歌文档，现在这种情况会自动发生。

218
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,380
resume Monday night version, resume Tuesday, or whatever the case may be.
但对于代码来说，它可以自动发生，也可以

219
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,500
If you're using Google documents, this happens automatically nowadays.
使用这种工具更系统地进行。

220
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,830
But with code, it can happen automatically, but also
Git是一个非常流行的工具，它可以与他人进行协作。

221
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,380
more methodically using this here tool.
你实际上一直在暗中使用它，

222
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,130
And Git is a very popular tool for collaborating with others as well.
在CS50的许多工具背后。

223
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,050
And you've actually been secretly using it
但我们隐藏了一些细节。

224
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,540
underneath the hood for a lot of CS50's tools.
但布莱恩通过这个视频和其他一些参考资料，

225
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,490
But we've abstracted away some of the details.
可以剥开抽象，向你展示如何手动使用它。

226
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,160
But Brian, via this video and any number of other references,
你不再需要使用cs50.dev，但你仍然可以使用。

227
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,500
can peel back that abstraction and show you how to use it more manually.
你可以在自己的Mac或PC上安装VS Code。

228
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,680
You don't need to use cs50.dev anymore but you are welcome to.
如果你访问这里第一个网址，它是一个免费下载。

229
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,820
You can instead install VS Code onto your own Mac or PC.
它实际上是开源的。

230
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,307
If you go to this first URL here, it's a free download.
所以你甚至可以深入了解它本身是如何构建的。

231
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,390
It's actually open source.
在CS50自己的文档中，我们提供了一些提示，

232
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,330
So you can even poke around and see how it, itself is built.
可以让你看起来像CS50的环境，即使从长远来看，

233
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,090
And at CS50's own documentation, we have some tips
你想要完全断开连接。

234
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:15,160
for making it look like CS50's environment even if longer term,
你现在能做什么呢？

235
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,490
you want to cut the cord entirely.
你们中的许多人会

236
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,730
What can you now do?
在最终项目中处理网站，

237
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,550
Well, many of you for your final projects
建立在问题集9、CS50金融和类似内容的基础上，

238
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,570
will typically tackle websites, sort of building on the ideas of problem
或者一般来说是动态的。

239
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:28,510
set 9, CS50 finance and the like, or just generally something dynamic.
但如果你想托管一个投资组合，比如你的简历，

240
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,940
But if you instead want to host a portfolio, like just your resume, just
你所完成的项目等等，静态网站

241
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,730
projects you've worked on and the like, a static websites
可以通过各种服务免费托管。

242
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,280
can be hosted for free via various services.
一个流行的服务是这里这个网址，叫做GitHub pages。

243
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,190
A popular one is this URL here, called GitHub pages.
还有一个提供免费层级服务的平台叫做

244
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,440
There's another service that offers a free tier called
Netlify，它可以让你免费静态托管自己的项目。

245
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,610
Netlify that can allow you to host your own projects statically for free.
但当涉及到更动态的托管时，你会有更多选择。

246
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,210
But when it comes to more dynamic hosting, you have many more options.
这些只是一些最受欢迎的选择。

247
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,140
And these are just some of the most popular.
前三个是当今最大的云提供商，

248
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,560
The first three are some of the biggest cloud providers
无论是亚马逊、微软Azure还是谷歌服务。

249
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,120
nowadays, whether it's Amazon or Microsoft Azure or Google services.
如果你访问这里第四个网址，它是GitHub的教育包，

250
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,967
If you go to this fourth URL here, this is GitHub's education pack,
他们与许多不同的公司合作，

251
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:06,300
they essentially broker with lots of different companies
为学生提供

252
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,760
to give students, specifically, discounts on
或免费使用许多工具。

253
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,550
or free access to a lot of tools.
所以你可能想在你有资格的时候注册它。

254
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,050
So you might want to sign up for that while you're eligible.
最后，这里还有两个其他流行的第三方服务，它们不是

255
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,350
And then lastly, here are two other popular third-party, but not
免费的，但非常普遍

256
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,480
free services, but that are very commonly
在你想要托管实际的web应用程序时使用。

257
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,798
used when you want to host actual web applications.
所以可能是Flask，也可能是其他东西，但它涉及到

258
00:13:20,798 --> 00:13:23,340
So maybe it's Flask, maybe it's something else, but something
一些输入和输出。

259
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,310
that involves some input and output.
与此同时，问题是——有很多社区。

260
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,170
Questions meanwhile-- so there's just lots of communities.
如果你想关注科技领域的最新动态，

261
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,190
If you want to keep an eye on what's happening in tech,
这些只是一些受欢迎的选择。

262
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,470
these are just some of the popular options.
毫无疑问，如果你有一些科技爱好者朋友，

263
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,735
And undoubtedly, if you have some techie friends,
他们也会有一些建议。

264
00:13:36,735 --> 00:13:38,110
they'll have suggestions as well.
你可能会发现这些地方很有趣。

265
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,590
But you might find some of these destinations of interest.
当然，越来越多的人会向软件本身提问，

266
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:44,970
Of course increasingly, will you just ask questions of software itself,
人工智能，无论是ChatGPT、GitHub Copilot还是其他。

267
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:50,020
AI, whether it's ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or the like.
然后是课程，我们显然对屏幕上显示的内容有些偏见。

268
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,320
And then classes, we're clearly a little biased here with what's on the screen.
所以这些课程不是大学课程本身，而是CS50团队

269
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,570
So these aren't college classes per se, but freely available OpenCourseWare
随着时间的推移，整理的免费开放式课程。

270
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,180
courses that CS50's team has put together over time.
简而言之，正如你从这些网址的后缀中可以推断的那样，

271
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,780
And in a nutshell as you can infer from the suffix of each of these URLs,
如果你想了解更多关于Python的信息，CS50

272
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,940
if you want to learn more about Python, CS50
有一个免费的在线公开课，或者关于SQL，感谢

273
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,150
has got a free, open online class for that, or SQL, thanks
卡特，还有关于web和人工智能的东西，感谢布莱恩，还有一门游戏课程，感谢科尔顿，

274
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:13,770
to Carter, web and AI stuff, thanks to Brian, a games class, thanks to Colton,
以及其他许多课程。

275
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,570
cybersecurity, which will extend where we leave off today.
网络安全，这将扩展我们今天结束的地方。

276
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,320
And then if you're more interested, not so
如果你更感兴趣，不是那么

277
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,590
much in coding and going more deeply into software,
对编码感兴趣，并且更深入地研究软件，

278
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:28,140
but want to take a step higher level and focus more on intersections of computer
但想更上一层楼，更多地关注计算机与

279
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,122
science with business or law or technology,
科学，商业，法律或技术的交叉点。

280
00:14:30,122 --> 00:14:31,830
those two are freely available, if you're
这两个是免费的，如果你

281
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,850
looking for something to do over January the summer or just to dabble over time.
正在寻找一些在1月，夏季或只是偶尔做的事情。

282
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,830
And there's innumerable other free resources
还有无数其他免费的资源

283
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:42,090
from other folks on the internet as well certainly too.
当然还有来自互联网上其他人的资源。

284
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,510
All right, so a few invitations and thank yous.
好吧，所以有一些邀请和感谢。

285
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:49,470
So one, after today, after we dive into and out of cybersecurity,
所以，第一，在今天之后，在我们深入和离开网络安全之后，

286
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,590
please do stay in touch via any of CS50's online communities.
请通过 CS50 的任何在线社区保持联系。

287
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,710
As we start to recruit next year's team for teaching fellows, teaching
随着我们开始招募明年的教学研究员团队，教学

288
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,560
assistants, course assistants, we'll be in touch via email
助理，课程助理，我们会通过电子邮件与您联系

289
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,030
for those opportunities as well.
这些机会也是如此。

290
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,780
And now some thanks for the group before we then dive into here today's topic.
现在，在我们深入今天的主题之前，感谢一下大家。

291
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,430
So one, allow me to thank our hosts here for giving us
首先，请允许我感谢我们的主办方，他们为我们提供了

292
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:12,150
access to such a wonderful, privileged space to just hold classes in,
如此美妙的特权空间来上课，

293
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,740
the whole team for Memorial Hall.
整个纪念堂团队。

294
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,610
Our thanks too, to ESS, which is the team that makes everything sound so
我们也要感谢 ESS，这是让所有事物在这样的空间中听起来很棒的团队，包括音乐，麦克风等等，我们的朋友

295
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,880
good in spaces like this with music, mics, and the like, our friends,
当然还有路上的韦斯利在昌肖，我们这个学期每个星期五都会去那里。

296
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,580
of course, Wesley down the road at Changsho, where we went most
如果你从来没有去过，或者你是在线上听到的，

297
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,380
every other Friday this semester.
请加入我们在路上的 Mass Ave 上昌肖的演出。

298
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,050
If you've never actually been, or if you're hearing this online,
随时都可以。

299
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,320
please join our friends at Changsho show on Mass Ave down the road
特别是 CS50 团队 - 房间里有很多工作人员

300
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,760
any time you might like.
在房间里操作摄像头，包括这里和后面，以及在线上。

301
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,970
And then especially, CS50's team-- there's quite a few humans
感谢大家。

302
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,320
operating cameras in the room, both here and way in back, as well as online.
[鼓掌]

303
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,340
My thanks.
感谢他们让这一切看起来和听起来都很好。

304
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,580
[APPLAUSE]
你看不到的是，当我真正搞砸了的时候，

305
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:48,020
Thank you to them for making this look and sound so good.
即使我们没有实时修复它，他们也很乐意

306
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,630
And what you don't see is when I do actually screw up,
帮助我们回到过去，修复问题，这样你的继任者就能拥有一个更好的版本了。

307
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,030
even if we don't fix it in real time, they very kindly
还有 CS50 的索菲·安德森，

308
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:56,870
help us go back in time, fix things, so that your successors have hopefully,
她是 CS50 教学研究员之一的女儿，

309
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,310
an even improved version as well.
住在新西兰，她以动画形式将 CS50 的鸭子带入了生活。

310
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:03,770
And then as well, CS50's own Sophie Anderson,
感谢索菲，这只鸭子现在无处不在，包括最近

311
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,050
who is the daughter of one of CS50's teaching fellows
出现在一些 T 恤上。

312
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,960
who lives all the way over in New Zealand, who has wonderfully
当然，我们有这个庞大的支持结构，

313
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,110
brought the CS50 duck to life in this animated form.
以团队的形式。

314
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,040
thanks to Sophie, this duck is now everywhere, including most recently,
这是我们一些过去的团队成员，但他们

315
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,660
on some T-shirts too.
在第七周通过 Zoom 向我们展示了 TCP/IP 的工作原理。

316
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,060
But of course, we have this massive support structure
他们通过传递信封来展示。

317
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,530
in the form of the team.
我当时评论说，免责声明，这实际上需要我们付出

318
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,810
This is some of our past team members, but who
很多努力。

319
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,690
wonderfully via Zoom you'll recall in week seven,
所以我认为我会分享我们整个教学团队的代表性感谢，

320
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:31,350
showed us how TCP/IP works by passing those envelopes up,
无论是卡特、茱莉亚、奥赞、科迪

321
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,510
down, left, and right.
以及所有在剑桥和新海的 C50 团队成员，

322
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,060
I commented at the time, disclaim, that it actually took us
我想让你看看幕后的事情是如何进行的。

323
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,600
quite a bit of effort to do that.
你看不到的幕后情况。

324
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,770
And so I thought I would share as a representative thanks
所以让我切换到这边并播放。

325
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:45,240
of our whole teaching team, whether it's Carter and Julia and Ozan and Cody
[视频播放]

326
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,930
and all of C50's team members in Cambridge in New Hey,
[听不见]

327
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:52,740
thought I'd give you a look behind the scenes at how things go indeed,
[听不见] 缓冲。

328
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,900
behind the scenes that you don't necessarily see.
好的。

329
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,243
So let me switch over here and hit play.
乔希？

330
00:16:58,243 --> 00:16:58,910
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
不错。

331
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,410
[INAUDIBLE]
海伦？

332
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,410
[INAUDIBLE] Buffering.
哦。

333
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,600
OK.
[笑]

334
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,440
Josh?
[听不见] 莫尼 - 不，哦，等等。

335
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,430
Nice.
太棒了，乔希。

336
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,079
Helen?
索菲。

337
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:07,819
Oh.
太棒了。

338
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,926
[CHUCKLING]
太完美了。

339
00:17:12,294 --> 00:17:14,144
[INAUDIBLE] Moni-- no, oh, wait.
莫尼。

340
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,019
That was amazing, Josh.
[笑] 我想我 -

341
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:26,144
Sophie.
[插话的声音]

342
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,700
Amazing.
轮到你了，[听不见]。

343
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,840
That was perfect.
盖伊。

344
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,340
Moni.
太棒了。

345
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,940
[LAUGHTER] I think I--
谢谢大家。

346
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,760
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
太好了。

347
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,620
- Over to you, [INAUDIBLE].
[播放结束]

348
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,120
Guy.
好的，这些片段除外，

349
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,310
That was amazing.
感谢整个教学团队让这堂课成为可能。

350
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,225
Thank you all.
[鼓掌]

351
00:17:54,225 --> 00:17:54,800
- So good.
所以，网络安全是指

352
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,240
[END PLAYBACK]
保护我们的系统、数据、帐户等的流程。

353
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,115
DAVID MALAN: All right, these outtakes aside,
而且它越来越重要，因为它

354
00:17:57,115 --> 00:18:00,510
my thanks to the whole teaching team for making this whole class possible.
已经存在，仅仅是因为技术无处不在，

355
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,497
[APPLAUSE]
在我们的桌子上，我们的腿上，我们的口袋里，以及其他地方。

356
00:18:03,497 --> 00:18:05,980
So cybersecurity, this refers to the process
那么到底是什么呢？

357
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,310
of keeping secure our systems, our data, our accounts, and.
我们如何作为过去几周的计算机科学学生，

358
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,550
More and it's something that's going to be increasingly important, as it
更深入地思考问题，更仔细地思考问题，

359
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,910
already is, just because of the sheer omnipresence of technology
或许甚至对我们的直觉进行量化，我想你们很多人

360
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,650
on our desks, on our laps, in our pockets, and beyond.
在决定时都会有这种直觉，某件事是安全的还是不安全的？

361
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,900
So exactly what is it?
首先，安全意味着什么？

362
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,650
And how can we, as students of computer science over the past many weeks,
作为世界公民，你们现在如何回答这个问题？

363
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,700
think about things a little more methodically, a little more carefully,
安全意味着什么？

364
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,060
and maybe even put some numbers to the intuition that I think a lot of you
观众：抵御攻击。

365
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,930
probably have when it comes to deciding, is something secure or is it not?
好的，所以抵御攻击，我喜欢这个说法。

366
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:38,170
So first of all, what does it mean for something to be secure?
关于安全含义的其他想法？

367
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:42,140
How might you as citizens of the world now answer that question?
这是什么意思？

368
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,510
What does it mean to be secure?
是的。

369
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,010
AUDIENCE: Resistant to attack.
观众：你控制谁有权访问它。

370
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,950
DAVID MALAN: OK, so resistant to attack, I like that formulation.
好的，所以抵御攻击，我喜欢这个说法。

371
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:52,110
Other thoughts on what it means to be secure?
关于安全含义的其他想法？

372
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,860
What does it mean?
这是什么意思？

373
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,388
Yeah.
是的。

374
00:18:53,388 --> 00:18:55,180
AUDIENCE: You control who has access to it.
观众：你控制谁有权访问它。

375
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:58,270
DAVID MALAN: Yeah, so you control who has access to something.
是的，所以你可以控制谁可以访问某些东西。

376
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,660
And there's these techniques known as authentication, like logging in,
这些技术被称为身份验证，就像登录一样，

377
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,910
authorization, deciding whether or not that person,
授权，决定那个人是否

378
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,220
once authenticated, should have access to things.
在经过身份验证后，应该有权访问这些东西。

379
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,110
And, of course, you and I are very commonly
当然，你我非常普遍地

380
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,900
in the habit of using fairly primitive mechanisms still.
习惯使用相当原始的机制。

381
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,688
Although, we'll touch today on some technologies
虽然，我们今天会涉及一些技术

382
00:19:13,688 --> 00:19:16,730
that we'll see all the more of in the weeks and months and years to come.
我们将在未来几周、几个月和几年中越来越多地看到这些技术。

383
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,480
But you and I are pretty much in the habit
但你我都有这样的习惯

384
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,393
of relying on passwords for most everything still today.
在今天，我们几乎依靠密码来完成大部分事情。

385
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,560
And so we thought we'd begin with exactly this topic
所以我们认为我们可以从这个主题开始

386
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,730
to consider just how secure or insecure is this mechanism and why
来思考这种机制究竟有多安全或不安全，以及为什么

387
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,755
and see if we can't evaluate it a little more
并看看我们是否可以对它进行更深入的评估

388
00:19:29,755 --> 00:19:32,380
methodically so that we can make more than intuitive arguments,
有条理地，以便我们能提出更多直观的论据，

389
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,940
but quantitative compelling arguments as well.
而是令人信服的定量论据。

390
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,890
So unfortunately we humans are not so good at choosing passwords.
不幸的是，人类不太擅长选择密码。

391
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,723
And every year, accounts are hacked into.
而且每年都有账户被黑。

392
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:44,140
Maybe yours, maybe your friends, maybe your family members
可能是你的，可能是你的朋友，可能是你的家人

393
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,640
have experienced this already.
已经经历过这样的事情。

394
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,100
And this unfortunately happens to so many people online.
不幸的是，这种情况发生在网上很多人的身上。

395
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,140
But, fortunately, there are security researchers
但幸运的是，世界上有安全研究人员

396
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:54,350
in the world that take a look at attacks once they have happened,
在攻击发生后，会对攻击进行调查，

397
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:58,550
particularly when data from attacks, databases, are posted online
特别是当攻击数据、数据库发布到网上时

398
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:01,250
or on the so-called dark web or the like and downloaded
或者在所谓的暗网上发布，或者类似的被下载

399
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,460
by others for malicious purposes, they can also conversely provide us
被其他人用于恶意目的，他们也可以反过来为我们提供

400
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,250
with some insights as to the behavior of us humans
关于人类行为的一些见解

401
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,770
that might give us some insights as to when and why things
这可能会给我们一些关于什么时候以及为什么这些事情

402
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,030
are getting attacked successfully.
被成功攻击的见解。

403
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,440
So as of last year, here, for instance, according to one measure
截至去年，例如，根据一项指标

404
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,680
are the top 10 most popular, a.k.a.
是前 10 个最流行的，也就是

405
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,770
worst passwords-- at least according to the data
最糟糕的密码——至少根据数据

406
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,080
that security researchers have been able to glean--
安全研究人员能够收集到的数据——

407
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,860
by attacks that have already happened.
通过已经发生的攻击。

408
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,960
So the number one password as of last year, according to systems compromised,
所以根据被入侵的系统，去年最流行的密码是

409
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,080
was 123456.
123456。

410
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,360
The second most, admin.
第二名是 admin。

411
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,970
The third most, 12345678.
第三名是 12345678。

412
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:51,080
And thereafter, 123456789, 1234, 12345, password, 123, Aa123456, and then
然后是 123456789、1234、12345、password、123、Aa123456，以及

413
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,150
1234567890.
1234567890。

414
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,710
So you can actually infer--
所以你实际上可以推断——

415
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,970
sort of goofy as some of these are-- you can actually infer certain policies
虽然这些密码有些愚蠢——但你实际上可以推断出某些策略

416
00:20:58,970 --> 00:20:59,720
from these, right?
从这些密码中推断出来，对吧？

417
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,402
The fact that we're taking such little effort to choose our password
我们选择密码付出的努力如此之少，这一事实

418
00:21:03,402 --> 00:21:05,360
seems to correlate really with probably, what's
似乎确实与可能是什么相关联，

419
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,400
the minimum length of a password required for systems?
系统要求的密码的最小长度？

420
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,580
And you can see that at worst, some systems
你可以看到，最糟糕的情况是，一些系统

421
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,670
require only three digit passwords.
只需要三位数的密码。

422
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:17,840
And maybe they might require six or eight or nine or even 10.
可能它们需要六位数、八位数、九位数甚至十位数的密码。

423
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,670
But you can kind of infer corporate or policies from these passwords alone.
但你仅仅从这些密码就可以推断出公司或策略。

424
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:26,318
If you keep going through the list, there's some funnier ones even down
如果你继续浏览这个列表，你会发现有些更有趣的东西，即使在

425
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,110
the list that are nonetheless enlightening.
这个列表中，它们仍然很有启发性。

426
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,820
So, for instance, lower on the list is Iloveyou, no spaces.
例如，在这个列表的下方是 Iloveyou，没有空格。

427
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,620
Sort of adorable, maybe it's meaningful to you.
有点可爱，也许对你来说很有意义。

428
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,860
But if you can think of it, so can an adversary,
但如果你能想到它，攻击者也能想到它，

429
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,750
so can some hacker, so much so that it's this popular on these lists.
一些黑客也能想到它，以至于它在这些列表中如此受欢迎。

430
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:48,660
Qwertyuiop, it's not quite English, but its derivative of English keyboards.
Qwertyuiop，它不完全是英文，但它是英文键盘的衍生词。

431
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,160
Anyone?
有人知道吗？

432
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,560
Yeah, so this is, if you look at a US English keyboard,
是的，所以，如果你看一个美式英文键盘，

433
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,450
it's just the top row of keys if you just
它就是最上面的那一排键，如果你只是

434
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:57,290
hit them all together left or right to choose your, therefore, password.
把它们全部从左到右一起敲，从而选择你的密码。

435
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:00,515
And then this one, "password," which has an at
然后是这个，“password”，它用一个@

436
00:22:00,515 --> 00:22:05,090
sign for the A and a zero for the O, which I guess I'm guessing some of you
符号代替 A，用 0 代替 O，我想我猜你们中有些人

437
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,402
do similar tricks.
也做过类似的把戏。

438
00:22:06,402 --> 00:22:09,110
But this is the thing too, if you think like you're being clever,
但这也是重点，如果你认为自己很聪明，

439
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,000
well, there's a lot of other adversaries,
那么，有很多其他的攻击者，

440
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,930
there's a lot of adversaries out there who are just as good at being clever.
有很多攻击者也和你一样聪明。

441
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:17,750
So even heuristics like this that in the past, to be fair,
所以即使是这种启发式方法，公平地说，在过去，

442
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,330
you might have been taught to do because it confuses
你可能会被教导要这样做，因为它会迷惑

443
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,900
adversaries' or hackers' attempts, unfortunately, if you know to do it,
攻击者或黑客的尝试，不幸的是，如果你知道怎么做，

444
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,260
so does the adversary.
攻击者也知道怎么做。

445
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,550
And so your accounts aren't necessarily any more secure as a result.
所以你的账户不一定因此而更加安全。

446
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,490
So what are some of our takeaways from this?
那么，我们从中学到了什么？

447
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:36,590
Well, one, if you have these lists of passwords, all too possible
好吧，首先，如果你拥有这些密码列表，那么字典攻击就太有可能了

448
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,920
are, for instance, dictionary attacks.
例如，字典攻击。

449
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,147
Like we literally have published on the internet--
就像我们实际上已经发布在互联网上——

450
00:22:42,147 --> 00:22:44,480
and there's a citation in the slides if you're curious--
如果你好奇的话，幻灯片中有一篇参考文献——

451
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,340
of these most popular passwords in the world.
这些世界上最流行的密码。

452
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,230
So what's a smart adversary going to do when trying to get into your account?
所以，一个聪明的攻击者在试图进入你的账户时会怎么做？

453
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,800
They're not necessarily going to try all possible passwords
他们不会尝试所有可能的密码

454
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,790
or try your birthday or things like that.
或者尝试你的生日之类的。

455
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,690
They're just going to start with this top 10 list, this top 100 list.
他们只会从这个前十名列表，这个前一百名列表开始。

456
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:58,880
And odds are, statistically, in a room this big,
而且，从统计学上来说，在一个这么大的房间里，

457
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,240
they're probably going to get into at least one person's account.
他们很可能至少会进入一个人的账户。

458
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,710
But let's consider maybe a little more academically what we can do about this.
但让我们从学术的角度考虑一下我们可以做些什么。

459
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:10,502
And let's start with something simple like the simplest, the most
让我们从简单的事情开始，比如最简单、最

460
00:23:10,502 --> 00:23:12,710
omnipresent device we might all have now is some kind

461
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,270
of mobile device like a phone.
移动设备，比如手机。

462
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,610
Generally speaking, Apple and Google and others

463
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,560
are requiring of us that we at least have
要求我们至少拥有

464
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,990
a passcode or at least you're prompted to set it up
一个密码，或者至少会提示你设置它

465
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,560
even if you therefore opt out of it.
即使你因此选择退出。

466
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,470
But most of us probably have a passcode, be it numeric or alphabetic
但我们大多数人可能都有一个密码，无论是数字还是字母

467
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,590
or something else.
或者其他东西。

468
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:31,318
So what might we take away from that?
那么我们能从中学到什么？

469
00:23:31,318 --> 00:23:33,110
Well, suppose that you do the bare minimum.
好吧，假设你只做最基本的事情。

470
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,235
And the default for years has generally been having
多年来，默认情况下，

471
00:23:35,235 --> 00:23:37,790
at least four digits in your passcode.
你的密码至少要有四位数。

472
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,240
Well, what does that mean?
那么这意味着什么？

473
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,758
Well, how secure is that?
好吧，那有多安全？

474
00:23:40,758 --> 00:23:42,050
How quickly might it be hacked?
它可能会被黑客攻击多快？

475
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,480
And, in fact, Carter, would you mind joining me up here?
事实上，卡特，你介意和我一起上来吗？

476
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,330
Perhaps we can actually decide together how best to proceed here.
也许我们可以一起决定在这里如何才能最好地进行。

477
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,670
If you want to flip over to your other screen there,
如果你想翻转到你的另一个屏幕，

478
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,390
we're going to ask everyone to go to--
我们要让每个人都去——

479
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:59,140
I'll pull it up here-- this URL here if you haven't already.
我将把它拉到此处——如果您还没有访问过，请访问此 URL。

480
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,980
And this is going to pull up a polling website that's
这将打开一个投票网站，

481
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,100
going to allow you in a moment to answer some multiple choice questions.
一会儿，它将允许您回答一些多项选择题。

482
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,160
This is the same URL as earlier if you already logged in.
如果您已经登录，则此 URL 与之前的 URL 相同。

483
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,220
And in just a moment, we're going to ask you a question.
一会儿，我们要问你一个问题。

484
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,030
And I think, can we show the question before we do this?
我想，我们可以在这样做之前显示问题吗？

485
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,700
Here's the first question from Carter here.
这是卡特提出的第一个问题。

486
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,190
How long might it take to crack--
破解一个四位数的密码可能需要多长时间？

487
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,750
that is, figure out-- a four-digit passcode on someone's phone,
也就是说，找出——手机上的四位数密码，

488
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,110
for instance?
例如？

489
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:33,230
How long might it take to crack a four-digit passcode?
破解一个四位数的密码可能需要多长时间？

490
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,280
Why don't we go ahead and flip over to see who is typing in what.
为什么我们不翻转过去看看谁在打什么。

491
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,540
And we'll see what the scores are already.
然后我们会看看分数是多少。

492
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,750
All right, and it looks like most of you think a few seconds.
好的，看起来大多数人认为几秒钟。

493
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,160
Some of you think a few minutes, a few hours, a few days.
有些人认为几分钟，几小时，几天。

494
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,908
So I'd say most of you are about to be very unpleasantly surprised.
所以我会说，大多数人将很快就会感到非常不愉快地惊讶。

495
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:53,450
In fact, the winner here is indeed going to be a few seconds,
事实上，这里获胜的将是几秒钟，

496
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,822
but perhaps even faster than that.
但可能比那还要快。

497
00:24:55,822 --> 00:24:57,530
So, in fact, let me go ahead and do this.
所以，事实上，让我继续做这个。

498
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,100
Thank you to Carter.
谢谢卡特。

499
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,900
Let me flip over and let me introduce you
让我翻转过来，并向你介绍

500
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,990
to, unfortunately, what's a very real world problem known as a brute force
不幸的是，一个被称为暴力破解的现实世界问题。

501
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,560
attack.
攻击。

502
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,360
As the word kind of conjures, if you think
正如这个词所暗示的那样，如果你想到

503
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,360
to-- back to yesteryear when there was some kind of battering ram trying
到——回到过去，当时有一种攻城锤试图

504
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,710
to brute force their way into a castle door,
暴力破解进入城堡大门，

505
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,440
it just meant trying to hammer the heck out of a system.
它只是意味着试图猛烈地攻击系统。

506
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,670
A castle, in that case, to get into the destination.
在这种情况下，城堡，为了进入目的地。

507
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:20,760
Digitally though, this might mean being a little more clever.
但在数字世界中，这可能意味着更加聪明一些。

508
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,610
We all know how to write code in a bunch of different languages now.
我们现在都知道如何用多种不同的语言编写代码。

509
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:28,080
You could maybe open up a text editor, write a Python program to try all
你或许可以打开一个文本编辑器，编写一个 Python 程序，尝试所有

510
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:35,760
possible four-digit codes from 0000 to 9999 in order to figure out exactly,
可能的四位数代码，从 0000 到 9999，以便准确地找出，

511
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,770
how long does it actually take?
它实际上需要多长时间？

512
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,990
So let's first consider this.
所以让我们先考虑这一点。

513
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,550
Let me ask the next question.
让我问下一个问题。

514
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,252
How many four-digit passcodes are there?
有多少个四位数的密码？

515
00:25:43,252 --> 00:25:45,960
Carter, if you wouldn't mind joining me and maybe just staying up
卡特，如果你不介意加入我，也许就留在这里

516
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,620
with me here to run our second question at this same URL.
和我一起在这里运行我们在这个相同 URL 上的第二个问题。

517
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:53,460
How many four-digit passcodes are there in the world?
世界上有多少个四位数的密码？

518
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,380
On your phone or laptop, you should now see the second question.
在你的手机或笔记本电脑上，你应该现在就能看到第二个问题。

519
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:05,677
And the answers include 4, 40, 9,999, 10,000, or it's OK to be unsure.
答案包括 4、40、9999、10000，或者不确定也可以。

520
00:26:05,677 --> 00:26:07,510
Let's go ahead and flip over to the results.
让我们翻转到结果页面。

521
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,620
And it looks like most of you think 10,000.
看起来大多数人认为是 10000。

522
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,870
And, indeed, that is the case.
确实如此。

523
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:16,010
Because if I kind of led you with 0000 to 9999, that's 10,000 possibilities.
因为如果我引导你从 0000 到 9999，那就是 10000 种可能性。

524
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,140
So that is, in fact, a lot.
所以，事实上，这是一个很大的数字。

525
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:21,520
But most of you thought it'd take maybe a few seconds to actually brute force
但大多数人认为，实际上暴力破解可能只需要几秒钟。

526
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,700
your way into that.
破解进入它。

527
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,380
Let's consider how we might measure how long that actually takes.
让我们考虑一下如何测量实际需要多长时间。

528
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:26,950
So thank you.
谢谢。

529
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,890
So in the world of a four-digit passcode-- and they
所以，在四位数密码的世界中——它们

530
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,220
are, indeed, digits, decimal digits from 0 to 9--
确实是数字，从 0 到 9 的十进制数字——

531
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,470
another way to think about it is there's 10 possibilities for the first digit,
另一种思考方式是，第一个数字有 10 种可能性，

532
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,750
10 for the next, 10 to the 10.
下一个有 10 种，10 的 10 次方。

533
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:42,340
So that really gives us 10 times itself four times or 10,000 in total.
所以，这实际上给了我们 10 自乘四次，或者总共 10000。

534
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,083
But how long does that actually take?
但实际上需要多长时间？

535
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:45,500
Well, let me go ahead and do this.
好吧，让我继续做这个。

536
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,300
I'm going to go ahead and open up on my Mac here, not even--
我将继续在我的 Mac 上打开它，甚至不用——

537
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,160
not even Codespaces or cs50.dev today.
今天甚至不用 Codespaces 或 cs50.dev。

538
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,290
I'm going to open up VS Code itself.
我将打开 VS Code 本身。

539
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:58,340
So before class, I went ahead and installed VS Code on my own Mac here.
所以，在上课之前，我已经在我的 Mac 上安装了 VS Code。

540
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:01,453
It looks almost the same as Codespaces, though the windows
它看起来几乎和 Codespaces 一样，虽然窗口

541
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,620
might look a little different and the menus as well.
可能看起来有点不同，菜单也是一样。

542
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,590
And I've gone ahead here and begun a file called crack.py.
我在这里已经开始了一个名为 crack.py 的文件。

543
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,230
To crack something means to break into it,
破解某物意味着闯入它，

544
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:12,300
to figure out in this case what the passcode actually is.
在这种情况下，找出密码实际上是什么。

545
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,970
Well, how might I write some code to try all 10,000 possible passcodes?
好吧，我该如何编写代码来尝试所有 10000 种可能的密码？

546
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,310
And, heck, even though this isn't quite going
而且，哎呀，即使这并不完全是

547
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,110
to be like hacking into my actual phone, I
像黑进我的真实手机一样，我

548
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:24,920
bet I could find a USB or a lightning cable, connect the two devices,
我敢肯定我可以找到一根 USB 或 Lightning 数据线，连接这两个设备，

549
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,740
and maybe send all of these passcodes to my device trying to brute force
并将所有这些密码发送到我的设备，试图暴力破解

550
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,240
my way in.
我的方式。

551
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,940
And that's indeed how a hacker might go about doing this
而这正是黑客可能会采取的行动方式

552
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,290
if the manufacturer doesn't protect against that.
如果制造商没有防范这种情况。

553
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,300
So here's some code.
这是一些代码。

554
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,530
Let me go ahead and do this.
让我继续做这个。

555
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,750
From string, import digits.
从字符串中导入数字。

556
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,250
This isn't strictly necessary.
这不是严格必要的。

557
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,830
But in Python, there is a string library from which
但在 Python 中，有一个字符串库，你可以从中

558
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,050
you can get all of the decimal digits just so I don't
获取所有十进制数字，这样我就不必

559
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,730
have to manually type out 0 through 9.
手动输入 0 到 9。

560
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,530
But that's just a minor optimization.
但这只是一个小的优化。

561
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:51,200
But there's another library called itertools,
但还有一个名为 itertools 的库，

562
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,670
tools related to iteration, doing things in like a looping fashion, where
与迭代相关的工具，以循环的方式做事情，

563
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,520
I can import a cross product function, a function that's
我可以导入一个交叉乘积函数，一个能够

564
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,460
going to allow me to combine like all numbers with all numbers
让我将所有数字与所有数字组合起来的函数

565
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,890
again and again and again for the length of the passcode.
一遍又一遍，直到密码长度结束。

566
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,220
Now I can do a simple Python for loop like this.
现在我可以像这样写一个简单的Python循环。

567
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:14,430
For each passcode in the cross product of those 10 digits repeated four times.
对于那些重复四次的十个数字的交叉乘积中的每个密码。

568
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:18,020
In other words, this is just a programmatic Pythonic way
换句话说，这只是一个以编程方式用Python实现的

569
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,980
to implement the idea of combining all 10 digits with itself
将所有10位数字与自身组合的思想，

570
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,170
four times in a loop in this fashion.
用这种方式在循环中进行四次。

571
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,540
And just so we can visualize this, let's just go ahead
为了可视化，我们继续

572
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,040
and print out the passcode.
打印出密码。

573
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,100
But if I did have a lightning cable or a USB cable, I wouldn't print it.
但是，如果我有一个闪电线或USB线，我不会打印它。

574
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,530
I would maybe send it through the cable to the device
我可能会通过电缆将它发送到设备

575
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,990
to try to get through the passcode screen.
以尝试通过密码屏幕。

576
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,390
So we can revisit now the question of how long
现在我们可以重新审视这个问题，即需要多长时间

577
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,070
might it take to get into this device.
才能进入这个设备。

578
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,240
Well, let's just try this.
好吧，我们试一下。

579
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,100
Python of crack.py.
Python的crack.py。

580
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,050
And assume, again, it's connected via cable.
并且假设，再次，它是通过电缆连接的。

581
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:49,280
So we'll see how long this program takes to run and break into this here phone.
所以我们将看看这个程序运行并破解这个手机需要多长时间。

582
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,480
Done.
完成了。

583
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,820
So that's all it took for 10,000 iterations.
所以这只是10,000次迭代所需要的。

584
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,720
And this is on a Mac that's not even the fastest one out there.
这是在一台Mac上，它甚至不是最快的。

585
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,530
You could imagine doing this even faster.
你可以想象更快地做到这一点。

586
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:02,180
So that's actually not necessarily all the best for our security.
所以，这实际上并不一定是我们安全的最佳选择。

587
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,250
So what could we do instead of 10 digits?
那么，除了10位数字，我们还能做什么？

588
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,190
Well, most of you have probably upgraded a lot of your passwords
好吧，你们中的大多数人可能已经升级了你们的密码，

589
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:10,560
to maybe being alphabetical instead.
可能改为字母顺序。

590
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,970
So what if I instead were to ask the question-- and Carter, if you
那么，如果我改为问这个问题——卡特，如果你

591
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:17,300
want to rejoin me here in a second-- what if I instead were to consider
想在几秒钟后重新加入我——如果我改为考虑

592
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,160
maybe four-letter passcodes?
也许是四位字母密码？

593
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,060
So now we have A through Z four times.
所以现在我们有A到Z，重复四次。

594
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,557
And maybe we'll throw into the mix uppercase and--
也许我们会加入大写字母和——

595
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:27,140
well, let's just keep it four letters.
好吧，我们还是保留四个字母。

596
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,220
Let's just go ahead and do maybe uppercase and lowercase,
让我们继续，也许大写和小写，

597
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,430
so 52 possibilities.
所以有52种可能性。

598
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:39,080
This is going to give us 52 times 52 times 52 times 52.
这将给我们52乘以52乘以52乘以52。

599
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,870
And anyone want to ballpark the math here,
有人想在这里估计一下数学结果吗？

600
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:48,800
how many possible four-letter passcodes are there, roughly?
大约有多少个可能的四位字母密码？

601
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,400
7 million, yeah, so roughly 7 million, which is way bigger than 10,000.
700万，是的，所以大约700万，这比10,000大得多。

602
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,560
So, oh, I spoiled this, didn't I?
所以，哦，我把它说漏了，是不是？

603
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,550
Can you flip over?
你能翻过来吗？

604
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:02,720
So how many four-letter passcodes are there?
所以，有多少个四位字母密码？

605
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,550
It seems that most of you, 93% of you, in fact, got the answer right.
看来你们中的大多数人，事实上，有93%的人答对了。

606
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,860
Those of you who are changing your answer-- there
那些正在改变答案的人——

607
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,090
we go, no, definitely not that.
我们继续，不，绝对不是那样。

608
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,310
So, anyhow, I screwed up.
所以，无论如何，我搞砸了。

609
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:16,820
Order of operations matters in computing and, indeed, including lectures.
在计算中，运算顺序很重要，当然，包括讲座。

610
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,250
So 7 million, so the segue I wanted to make
所以，700万，所以我想做的是

611
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,200
is, OK, how long does that actually take to implement in code?
是，好吧，实际上用代码实现需要多长时间？

612
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,860
Well, let me just tweak our code here a little bit.
好吧，让我稍微调整一下我们的代码。

613
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:30,320
Let me go ahead and go back into the VS Code on my Mac in which I
让我继续，回到我的Mac上的VS Code，在那里我

614
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,790
had the same code as before.
拥有与之前相同的代码。

615
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:36,050
So let me shrink my terminal window, go back to the code from which I began.
所以让我缩小我的终端窗口，回到我开始使用的代码。

616
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:38,270
And let's just actually make a simple change.
让我们只做一个小小的改变。

617
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:42,320
Let me go ahead and simply change digits to something called ASCII letters.
让我继续，简单地将数字更改为名为ASCII字母的东西。

618
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,000
And this too is just a time saving technique.
这也是一种节省时间的方法。

619
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,450
So I don't have to type out A through Z and uppercase and lowercase like 52
所以我不必像52那样打出A到Z，以及大写和小写

620
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,410
total times.
总共次数。

621
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:52,650
And so I'm going to change digits to ASCII letters.
所以我要把数字改为ASCII字母。

622
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,360
And we'll get a quantitative sense of how long this takes.
我们将定量了解这需要多长时间。

623
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,170
So Python of crack.py, here's how long it takes
所以，Python的crack.py，这是完成700万次可能性所需的时间

624
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:01,380
to go through 7 million possibilities.
所需的时间。

625
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,243
All right, clearly slower because we haven't seen the end of the list yet.
好吧，很明显比较慢，因为我们还没有看到列表的结尾。

626
00:31:05,243 --> 00:31:08,160
And you can see we're going through all of the lowercase letters here.
你可以看到我们正在遍历这里的所有小写字母。

627
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,160
We're about to hit Z. But now we're going through the uppercase letters.
我们即将到达Z。但现在我们正在遍历大写字母。

628
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,850
So it looks like the answer this time is going to be a few seconds, indeed.
所以看起来这次的答案是几秒钟，确实如此。

629
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:17,340
But definitely less than a minute would seem, at least
但至少看起来肯定不到一分钟

630
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,570
on this particular computer.
在这台特定的电脑上。

631
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,190
So odds are if I'm the adversary and I've
所以，如果我是对手，并且我

632
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,020
plugged this phone into someone's device-- maybe
将这部手机插到别人的设备上——也许

633
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,510
I'm not here in a lecture, but in Starbucks or an airport
我不是在这里上课，而是在星巴克或机场

634
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,360
or anywhere where I have physical opportunity to grab that device
或者任何我可以 physically 获得该设备的地方

635
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,320
and plug a cable in-- it's not going to take long to hack into that device
并插上电缆——破解那个设备不需要很长时间

636
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:31,890
either.
也是。

637
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,980
So what might be better than just digits and letters from the real world?
那么，除了现实世界中的数字和字母之外，还有什么更好的选择呢？

638
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:39,090
So add in some punctuation, which like almost every website
所以，添加一些标点符号，就像几乎所有网站

639
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,810
requires that we do.
要求我们做的那样。

640
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:44,640
Well, if we want to add punctuation into the mix, if I can get this segue
好吧，如果我们想添加标点符号，如果我能让这个衔接

641
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,060
correct so that we can now ask Carter one last time,
正确，这样我们现在可以最后一次问卡特，

642
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:52,860
how many four-character passcodes are possible where a character is
有多少个可能的四位字符密码，其中一个字符是

643
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:57,870
an uppercase or lowercase letter or a decimal digit or a punctuation symbol?
大写字母或小写字母或十进制数字或标点符号？

644
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,420
If you go to your device now, you'll see--
如果你现在去你的设备，你会看到——

645
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,130
if we want to flip over to the screen--
如果我们想翻到屏幕——

646
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,750
these possibilities.
这些可能性。

647
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:08,050
There's a million, maybe, a billion, a trillion, a quadrillion,
有一百万，也许，十亿，万亿，千万亿，

648
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:12,510
or a quintillion when it comes to a-- oh, wrong question.
或者百亿亿，当谈到一个——哦，问错了。

649
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,220
Wow, we're new here, OK.
哇，我们刚来这里，好吧。

650
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,410
OK, we're going to escalate things here.
好吧，我们要升级一下这里的事情。

651
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,780
How many eight-character passcodes are possible?
有多少个可能的八位字符密码？

652
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:23,670
We're going to make things more secure, even though I said four.
我们要让它更安全，即使我说的是四位。

653
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:26,430
We're now making it more secure to eight.
我们现在要把它设置为八位，以提高安全性。

654
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:29,650
All right, you want to flip over to the chart?
好的，你想翻到图表吗？

655
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,800
All right, so it looks like most of you are now
好吧，所以看起来你们中的大多数人现在

656
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,900
erring on the side of quintillion or quadrillion.
倾向于百亿亿或千万亿。

657
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,862
1% of you still said million, even though there's definitely more
你们中有 1% 的人仍然说百万，即使现在肯定比之前更多了

658
00:32:37,862 --> 00:32:39,070
than there were a moment ago.
比之前更多。

659
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,790
But that's OK.
但这没关系。

660
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,470
So quadrillion-- quintillion is still winning.
所以四千万亿，五千万亿仍然领先。

661
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:45,290
And I think if we go and reveal this, with the math,
我认为如果我们用数学来揭示这一点，

662
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:48,070
you should be doing is 94 to the 4th power.
你应该做的是 94 的四次方。

663
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:53,290
Because there's 26 plus 26 plus 10 plus some more digits,
因为有 26 加 26 加 10 加一些更多的数字，

664
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,190
some punctuation digits in there as well.
还有标点符号。

665
00:32:55,190 --> 00:33:00,670
So it's actually, oh, this is the other example, isn't it?
所以实际上，哦，这是另一个例子，不是吗？

666
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,990
This is embarrassing.
这太尴尬了。

667
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:04,930
All right, we had a good run in the past nine weeks instead.
好吧，我们过去九周表现还不错。

668
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:08,950
All right, so if you were curious as to how many four-character passwords are
好吧，如果你想知道有多少个四位字符的密码

669
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,330
possible, it's 78 million.
是可能的，那就是 7800 万。

670
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,890
But that's not the question at hand.
但这不是我们现在的问题。

671
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:15,470
The question at hand was, how many eight character passcodes are there?
问题是，有多少个八位字符的密码？

672
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,680
And in this case, the math you would be doing
在这种情况下，你应该做的数学运算

673
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,710
is 94 to the 8th power, which is a really big number.
是 94 的八次方，这是一个非常大的数字。

674
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,770
And, in fact, it's this number here, which
实际上，就是这里这个数字，它

675
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:27,100
is roughly 6 quadrillion possibilities.
大约有 6 万亿种可能性。

676
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,830
Now, I could go about actually doing this in code here.
现在，我可以在这里用代码来做这件事。

677
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,010
So let me actually, for a final flourish,
所以，为了最后一次点缀，

678
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,590
let me open up VS Code one last time here.
让我最后一次打开 VS Code。

679
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:39,730
And in VS Code, I'm going to go ahead and shrink my terminal window,
在 VS Code 中，我要缩小我的终端窗口，

680
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:43,300
go back into the code, and I'm going to import not just ASCII letters, not just
回到代码中，我不仅要导入 ASCII 字母，不仅要

681
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,580
digits, but punctuation as well, which is
导入数字，还要导入标点符号，它

682
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,070
going to give me like 32 punctuation symbols
将给我大约 32 个标点符号

683
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,762
from a typical US English keyboard.
来自一个典型的美国英语键盘。

684
00:33:49,762 --> 00:33:52,720
And I'm going to go ahead and just concatenate them all together in one
然后我要把它们全部连接在一起，放到一个

685
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,750
big list by using the plus operator in Python
大列表中，使用 Python 中的加号运算符

686
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,870
to plus in both digits and punctuation.
将数字和标点符号加到一起。

687
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,030
And I'm going to change the 4 to an 8.
我将把 4 改成 8。

688
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:04,090
So this now, it's what four actual lines of code
所以现在，它有四行实际的代码

689
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:06,910
is, all it takes for an adversary to whip up some code,
就是，攻击者只需要编写一些代码，

690
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:09,460
find a cable as step two, and hack into a phone that
第二步找到一根电缆，就可以破解一台有

691
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,949
even has eight-character passcodes.
八位字符密码的手机。

692
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:15,100
Let me enlarge in my terminal window here, run
让我放大我的终端窗口，运行

693
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,830
for a final time Python of crack.py.
最后一次运行 Python crack.py。

694
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:20,860
And this I'll actually leave running for some time.
我会让它运行一段时间。

695
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:25,000
Because you can get already sort of a palpable feel of how much slower it
因为你已经可以感觉到它慢了很多，

696
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,730
is-- because these characters clearly haven't moved--
因为这些字符明显没有移动，

697
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,947
how long it's going to take.
它要花多久时间。

698
00:34:28,947 --> 00:34:31,030
We might actually do-- need to do a bit more math.
我们可能需要做更多的数学运算。

699
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,820
Because doing just four-digit passcodes was super fast.
因为破解四位数字密码非常快。

700
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:37,630
Doing four-letter passcodes was slower, but still under a minute.
破解四位字母密码速度较慢，但也不到一分钟。

701
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:41,170
We'll see maybe in time how long this actually runs for.
我们来看看它到底要运行多久。

702
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:46,870
But this clearly seems to be better, at least for some definition of better.
但对于某种意义上的“更好”来说，这似乎明显更好了。

703
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:51,610
But it should hopefully not be that easy to hack into a system.
但希望破解系统不会那么容易。

704
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:57,180
What does your own device probably do to defend against that brute force attack?
你的设备可能做了什么来防御这种暴力攻击？

705
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,042
Yeah.
是的。

706
00:34:58,042 --> 00:34:59,280
AUDIENCE: Gives you a limited number of tries.
观众：限制你尝试的次数。

707
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,822
DAVID MALAN: Yeah, so it gives you a limited number of tries.
大卫·马兰：是的，它限制你尝试的次数。

708
00:35:01,822 --> 00:35:05,730
So odds are, at least once in your life, you've somehow locked yourself out
所以，你至少曾经有一次把自己锁在

709
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:09,748
of a device, typically after typing your passcode more than 10 times
设备外面，通常是你在输入密码超过 10 次

710
00:35:09,748 --> 00:35:12,540
or 10 attempts or maybe it's your siblings or your roommate's phone
或 10 次尝试之后，或者可能是你兄弟姐妹或室友的手机

711
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:16,540
that you realize this is a feature of iPhones and Android devices as well.
你才意识到，这也是 iPhone 和 Android 设备的一个功能。

712
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,780
But here's a screenshot of what an iPhone might
但这里是一个 iPhone 可能

713
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:23,740
do if you do try to input the wrong passcode maybe 10 or so times.
会做的事情，如果你尝试输入错误的密码 10 次左右。

714
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,770
Notice that it's really telling you to try again in one minute.
请注意，它会让你在一分钟后重新尝试。

715
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:30,030
So this isn't fundamentally changing what the adversary can do.
所以这并没有从根本上改变攻击者可以做的事情。

716
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:33,630
The adversary can absolutely use those same four lines of code with a cable
攻击者完全可以使用相同的四行代码和一根电缆

717
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,140
and try to hack into your device.
尝试破解你的设备。

718
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,510
But what has this just done?
但这做了什么？

719
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:40,770
It's significantly increased the cost to the adversary,
它大大增加了攻击者的成本，

720
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:43,620
where the cost might be measured in sheer number amount of time--
成本可以用时间来衡量，比如分钟、秒、小时、天或更长时间。

721
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,080
like minutes, seconds, hours, days, or beyond.
分钟、秒、小时、天或更长时间。

722
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,520
Maybe it's increased the cost in the sense of risk.
也许它从风险的角度提高了成本。

723
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,020
Why?
为什么？

724
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,480
Because if this were like a movie incarnation of this
因为如果这像电影中的情节一样

725
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,640
and the adversary has just plugged into the phone
攻击者刚刚连接到手机

726
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,098
and is kind of creepily looking around until you come back,
并且在你看不到的时候偷偷地四处张望，直到你回来，

727
00:35:56,098 --> 00:36:00,490
it's going to take way too long for them to safely get away with that,
他们要安全地逃脱，需要花费太长时间，

728
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:03,370
assuming your passcode is not 123456, it's
假设你的密码不是 123456，而是

729
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,930
somewhere in the middle of that massive search space.
处于那个巨大的搜索空间的中间位置。

730
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:09,687
So this just kind of fundamentally raises the bar to the adversary.
所以，这从根本上提高了攻击者的门槛。

731
00:36:09,687 --> 00:36:12,520
And that's one of the biggest takeaways of cybersecurity in general.
这正是网络安全的一大启示。

732
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,270
It's completely naive to think in terms of absolute security
认为绝对的安全，完全是天真幼稚的。

733
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:19,480
or to even say a sentence like "my website is secure" or even
或者说“我的网站很安全”这样的话，甚至

734
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,260
"my home is physically secure."
“我的家很安全”。

735
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:21,760
Why?
为什么？

736
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,220
Well, for a couple of reasons, like, one, an adversary
有很多原因，比如，首先，一个攻击者

737
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:27,370
with enough time, energy, motivation, or resources
只要有足够的时间、精力、动力或资源

738
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:31,840
can surely get into most any system and can surely get into most any home.
肯定可以破解大多数系统，肯定可以进入大多数房屋。

739
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,105
But the other thing to consider, unfortunately,
但不幸的是，还有另外一点需要考虑，

740
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:36,730
that if we're the good people in this story and the adversaries
如果我们是在这个故事中扮演好人，而攻击者

741
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:40,480
are the bad people, you and I rather have to be perfect.
是坏人，你我必须完美无缺。

742
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,200
In the physical world, we have to lock every door, every window.
在现实世界中，我们必须锁上每一扇门，每一扇窗户。

743
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,367
Because if we mess up just one spot, the adversary can get in.
因为只要我们犯一个错误，攻击者就可以进来。

744
00:36:48,367 --> 00:36:50,200
And so where there's sort of this imbalance.
因此，这种不平衡存在于

745
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,750
The adversary just has to find the window that's
攻击者只需要找到窗户

746
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,370
ajar to get into your physical home.
开着，就可以进入你的家。

747
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,680
The adversary just needs to find one user who's
攻击者只需要找到一个

748
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,990
got a really bad password to somehow get into that system.
密码很糟糕的用户，就可以进入那个系统。

749
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,700
And so cybersecurity is hard.
网络安全很难。

750
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,180
And so what we'll see today really are techniques
所以我们今天将看到的是一些技巧

751
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,750
that can let you create a gauntlet of defenses-- so not just one,
可以让你构建一道防线，不仅仅是一道

752
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,310
but maybe two, maybe three.
而是可能两道，甚至三道。

753
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,730
And even if the adversary gets in, another tenant of cybersecurity
即使对手闯入了，网络安全另一个原则

754
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,910
is at least, let's have mechanisms in place that detect
至少是，让我们拥有能够检测到的机制

755
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:19,247
the adversary, some kind of monitoring, automatic emails.
对手，某种监控，自动邮件。

756
00:37:19,247 --> 00:37:21,580
You can increasingly see this already in the real world.
你可以在现实世界中越来越频繁地看到这一点。

757
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:25,360
If you log into your Instagram account from a different city or state
如果你从不同的城市或州登录你的 Instagram 账户

758
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,370
suddenly because maybe you're traveling, you
突然间，可能是因为你正在旅行，你会

759
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,890
will-- if you've opted into settings like these-- often
如果启用了这些设置，你经常会

760
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:32,110
get a notification or an email saying, hey,
收到通知或电子邮件，说，嘿，

761
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:35,890
you seems to have logged in from Palo Alto rather than Cambridge.
你好像是从帕洛阿尔托而不是剑桥登录的。

762
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,430
Is this, in fact, you?
这确实是你的操作吗？

763
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:40,030
So even though we might not be able to keep the adversary out,
所以，即使我们可能无法阻止对手进入，

764
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:43,000
let's at least minimize the window of opportunity or damage
让我们至少将可乘之机或造成的损害降到最低

765
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,990
by letting humans like us know that something's been compromised.
通过让我们这些人类知道某些东西已经被泄露。

766
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,490
Of course, there is a downside here.
当然，这里也存在弊端。

767
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:50,620
And this is another theme of cybersecurity.
这也是网络安全另一个主题。

768
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:54,680
Every time you improve something, you've got to pay a price.
每次你改进某些东西，你都得付出代价。

769
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,020
There's going to be a tradeoff.
会有权衡取舍。

770
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:00,250
And we've seen this with time and space and money and other such resources
我们在设计系统的时候，已经见识过时间、空间、金钱和这类资源方面的权衡取舍。

771
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,010
when it comes to designing systems already.
时间、空间、金钱和这类资源方面的权衡取舍。

772
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:06,940
What's the downside of this mechanism?
这种机制的弊端是什么？

773
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,800
Why is this perhaps a bad thing or what's the downside to you,
为什么这可能是一件坏事，或者对你来说，弊端是什么，

774
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,620
the good person in the story?
故事中的好人？

775
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,340
Yeah.
是的。

776
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,763
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
观众：[听不清]

777
00:38:14,763 --> 00:38:17,180
DAVID MALAN: Yeah, if you've just forgotten your passcode,
大卫·马兰：是的，如果你忘记了密码，

778
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,760
it's going to be more difficult for you to log in.
你登录就会更困难。

779
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,338
Or maybe you just really need to get into your phone now
或者你可能现在真的需要进入你的手机

780
00:38:23,338 --> 00:38:25,130
and you don't really want to wait a minute.
你不想等一分钟。

781
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,770
And if you, worse, if you keep trying, sometimes it'll
更糟糕的是，如果你一直尝试，有时会

782
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:30,320
change to two minutes, five minutes, one hour.
变成两分钟、五分钟、一个小时。

783
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,130
It'll increase exponentially.
它会呈指数级增长。

784
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:32,630
Why?
为什么？

785
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:35,660
Because Apple and Google figure that, they don't necessarily
因为苹果和谷歌认为，他们不一定

786
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,120
know what the right cutoff is.
知道正确的截止时间。

787
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,370
Maybe it's 10, maybe it's fewer, maybe it's more.
可能是 10 次，也可能更少，也可能更多。

788
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:43,130
But at some point, it is much more likely
但在某些时候，这更有可能是

789
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:46,698
that this is a hacker trying to get in than it is for getting your passcode.
黑客试图入侵，而不是你忘记密码。

790
00:38:46,698 --> 00:38:48,740
But in the corporate world, it can be even worse.
但在企业界，情况可能更糟。

791
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,668
There's a feature that lets phones essentially self-destruct whereby
有一个功能可以让手机自动销毁，这样

792
00:38:51,668 --> 00:38:53,460
rather than just waiting you wait a minute,
而不是仅仅让你等待一分钟，

793
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,882
it will wipe the device, more dramatically.
它会更剧烈地擦除设备。

794
00:38:55,882 --> 00:38:59,090
The presumption being that, no, no, no, no, no, if this is a corporate phone,
假设是，不，不，不，不，不，如果这是一部公司手机，

795
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:01,580
let's lock it down further so that it is an adversary,
让我们进一步锁定它，这样如果是一个对手，

796
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,460
the data is gone after 10 failed attempts.
数据会在 10 次尝试失败后消失。

797
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,220
But there's other mechanisms as well.
但也存在其他机制。

798
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,910
In addition to logging into phones via passcodes,
除了通过密码登录手机，

799
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,920
there's also websites like Gmail, for instance.
还有像 Gmail 这样的网站。

800
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,200
And it's very common, therefore, to log in to websites like these.
因此，登录这些网站非常普遍。

801
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,930
And odds are, statistically, a lot of you
从统计学上讲，你们很多人

802
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,630
are in the habit of reusing passwords.
有重复使用密码的习惯。

803
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,310
Like, no, don't nod if you are.
比如，不，如果你有，不要点头。

804
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,540
We have cameras everywhere.
到处都是摄像头。

805
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,680
But maybe you're in the habit of reusing it.
但你可能习惯了重复使用它。

806
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,180
Why?
为什么？

807
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:31,302
Because it's hard to remember really big long cryptic passwords.
因为很难记住真正很长很复杂的密码。

808
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,510
So mathematically, there's surely an advantage there.
所以从数学角度来说，这确实有优势。

809
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:33,870
Why?
为什么？

810
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:36,150
Because it just makes it so much harder, more time-consuming,
因为这使得对手入侵变得更加困难，更加耗时，

811
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,930
more risky for an adversary to get in.
风险更大。

812
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:40,440
But the other tradeoff is like, my God, I just can't even
但另一个权衡是，我的天，我真的记不住

813
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,930
remember most of my passwords as a result
大部分密码了

814
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:47,245
unless I reuse the one good password I thought of and memorized already
除非我重复使用我想到并记住的那个好密码

815
00:39:47,245 --> 00:39:49,620
or maybe I write it down on a post-it note on my monitor,
或者我可能把它写在显示器上的便签纸上，

816
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,840
as all too often happens in corporate workplaces.
在企业工作场所，这种情况太常见了。

817
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,390
Or maybe you're being clever and in your top right drawer,
或者你可能很聪明，在你最上面的右边的抽屉里，

818
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:56,400
you've got a printout of all of your accounts.
你放着你所有账户的打印副本。

819
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,815
Well, if you do, like ha-ha, so do a lot of other people.
好吧，如果你这样做了，哈哈，很多人也这样做。

820
00:39:58,815 --> 00:40:00,690
Or maybe it's a little more secure than that,
或者可能比这更安全一点，

821
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:05,490
but there are sociological side effects of these technological policies that
但这些科技政策带来了社会影响，

822
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,980
really until recent years were maybe underappreciated.
直到最近几年才被人们认识到。

823
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,040
The academics, the IT administrators were mandating policies
学者们、IT 管理员们都强制要求这些政策

824
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,540
that you and I as human users were not necessarily behaving properly
而你我作为用户，并不一定会按照这些政策行事

825
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,650
in the face of.
面对这些政策。

826
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:19,530
So nowadays, there are things called password managers.
所以现在有叫做密码管理器的工具。

827
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:22,380
And a password manager is just a piece of software on Macs,
密码管理器仅仅是 Mac 上的一段软件，

828
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,440
on PCs, on phones that manage your passwords for you.
PC 上，手机上的一段软件，它可以为你管理密码。

829
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,540
What this means specifically is when you go

830
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,390
to a website for the very first time, you, the human,
第一次访问一个网站的时候，你，作为一个人类，

00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,490
don't need to choose your password anymore.
不再需要选择你的密码了。

832
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,340
You instead click a button or use some keyboard shortcut.

833
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:39,810
And the software generates a really long cryptic password for you

834
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,250
that's not even eight characters.

836
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:46,410
of randomness.

838
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:52,170
The software thereafter remembers that password

839
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:55,640
for you and even your username, whether it's your email address or something

840
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,140
else.

841
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:00,600
And it saves it onto your Mac or your phone or your PC's disk or hard drive.
它会将密码保存到你的 Mac、手机、PC 的磁盘或硬盘上。

842
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,840
The next time you visit that same website, what you can do

843
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,560

know anymore 99% of my own passwords.
不再知道我自己的 99% 的密码。

847
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:20,250
Rather, I rely on software like this to do the heavy lifting for me.
相反，我依靠像这样的软件来为我完成繁重的工作。

848
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:23,820
But there's an obvious downside here, which
但是这里有一个明显的缺点，那就是

might be what if you're doing this?

00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:26,862
Yeah.

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
观众：[听不清]

852
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,730
DAVID MALAN: Right, so what if they find out the one password
大卫·马兰：没错，那么如果他们发现保护这个软件的那个密码呢？

853
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,560
that's protecting this software?
那个保护这个软件的密码？

854
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,460
Because unstated by me up until now is that this password manager itself
因为我之前没有说明的是，这个密码管理器本身

855
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:42,270
has a primary password that protects all of those other eggs in the one basket,
有一个主密码，保护着所有那些其他在一个篮子里的鸡蛋，

856
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:42,860
so to speak.
可以这么说。

857
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,130
And my one primary password for my own password manager,
而我自己的密码管理器的唯一主密码，

858
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:48,022
it is really long and hard to guess.
它真的很长，很难猜到。

859
00:41:48,022 --> 00:41:49,730
And the odds that anyone's going to guess
而且任何人都能猜到的可能性

860
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:52,010
are just so low that I'm comfortable with that
实在是太低了，以至于我对此感到很舒服

being the one really difficult thing that I've committed to my memory.
成为我唯一要记住的难题。

862
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,150
But the problem is if someone does figure it out nonetheless somehow

863
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,310
or, worse, I forget what it is.
或者更糟的是，我忘记了它是什么。

00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,700
Now, I've not lost access to one account, but all of my accounts.
现在，我失去了对一个账户的访问权限，而是所有账户的访问权限。

865
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,620
Now, that might be too high of a price to pay.
现在，这可能是一个过高的代价。

866
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,620
But, again, if you're in the habit of choosing easy passwords like being
但是，再说一次，如果你习惯于选择像这样的简单密码

00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:13,310
on that top 10 list, reusing passwords, it's probably a net
出现在前十名的名单上，重复使用密码，这可能是一个

868
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:18,170
positive to incur this single risk versus the many risks you're
积极的做法，承担这个单一的风险，而不是你承担的许多风险

incurring across the board with all of these other sites.

There's third party software you can pay for and download.
有一些你可以付费下载的第三方软件。

874
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,412
But even then, I would beware.
但即使那样，我也会小心。

875
00:42:32,412 --> 00:42:34,620
And I would ask friends whose opinion you trust or do

876
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,570
some googling for reviews and the like.
在谷歌上搜索一些评论等等。

877
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:41,760
All too often in the software world have password managers

been determined to be buggy themselves.
被发现自身存在漏洞。

879
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:48,120
I mean, you've seen in weeks of CS50 how easy it is to introduce bugs.
我的意思是，你在 CS50 的几周里已经看到了引入漏洞是多么容易。

880
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,570
And even the best of programmers still introduce bugs to software.
即使是最好的程序员也会在软件中引入漏洞。

881
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:55,020
So you're also trusting that the companies making this password

882
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,430
management software is really good at it.

And that's not always the case.
但情况并不总是这样。

884
00:42:59,047 --> 00:42:59,880
So beware there too.

885
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,820
But we'll also focus today on some of the fundamentals
但我们今天也会关注这些公司可以用来更好地保护你的数据的几个基本原理。

that these companies can be using to better protect your data as well.
这些公司可以用来更好地保护你的数据。

887
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:09,000

888
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,812
Two-factor authentication, like most of us
双因素身份验证，就像我们大多数人一样

889
00:43:11,812 --> 00:43:14,020
probably have to use this for some of your accounts--

890
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:17,312
your Harvard account, your Yale account, maybe your bank accounts, or the like.
你的哈佛账户、你的耶鲁账户，也许还有你的银行账户等等。

891
00:43:17,312 --> 00:43:21,500
So what is two-factor authentication in a nutshell?
那么，双因素身份验证简而言之是什么呢？

892
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,630
Yeah.
是的。

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
观众：[听不清]

894
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:26,900
DAVID MALAN: Yeah, you get a second factor
大卫·马兰：没错，你获得了一个第二个因素

895
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,360
that you have to provide to the website or application
你需要提供给网站或应用程序，

896
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,520
to prove that it's you like a text to your phone
来证明是你，比如发送短信到你的手机

897
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,918
or maybe it's an actual application that gets push notifications or the like.
或者它可能是一个应用程序，它会发送推送通知等等。

898
00:43:34,918 --> 00:43:36,710
Maybe in the corporate world, it's actually
在公司里，它实际上是

899
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:40,100
a tiny little device with a screen on it that's on your keychain or the like.
一个带屏幕的小装置，放在你的钥匙链上等等。

900
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:43,430
Maybe it's actually a USB dongle that you have to plug into your work laptop.
它可能实际上是一个 USB 钥匙，你必须将其插入你的工作笔记本电脑。

901
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:45,380
In short, it's some second factor.
简而言之，它是第二个因素。

902
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,520
And by factor, I mean something technical.
而因素的意思是技术上的东西。

903
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,840
It's not just a second password, which would be one factor.
它不仅仅是第二个密码，那只是一个因素。

904
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,980
It's a second fundamentally different factor.
它是第二个从根本上不同的因素。

905
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,950
So generally speaking in the world of two-factor authentication or 2FA or MFA
所以，一般来说，在双因素身份验证或 2FA 或 MFA 的世界里

906
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:00,710
is the generalization as multi-factor authentication,
更一般地说，是多因素身份验证，

907
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:03,770
you have not just a password, which is something you know,
你不止有一个密码，那是你知道的东西，

908
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:06,750
the second factor is usually something you have--
第二个因素通常是你拥有的东西——

909
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,830
whether it's your phone or that application or the keychain.
无论是你的手机、那个应用程序还是钥匙链。

910
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:12,830
It might also be biometrics like your fingerprints, your retinas,
它也可能是生物识别技术，比如你的指纹、你的视网膜，

911
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:14,990
or something else physically about you.
或者其他关于你身体的东西。

912
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:18,180
But it's something that significantly decreases the probability
但它能够显著降低某个攻击者进入那个账户的可能性。

913
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,430
that some adversary is going to get into that account.
某个攻击者进入那个账户的可能性。

914
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:20,810
Why?
为什么？

915
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:23,460
Because right now, if you've only got a username and password,
因为现在，如果你只有用户名和密码，

916
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,640
your adversaries are literally every human in the world
你的攻击者实际上是世界上所有的人

917
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,350
with an internet connection, arguably.
拥有互联网连接的人，可以说是这样。

918
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:30,750
But as soon as you introduce 2FA, now it's
但一旦你引入了 2FA，现在就只有

919
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:34,500
only people on campus or, more narrowly, only the people in Starbucks
校园里的人，或者更确切地说，只有在星巴克的人

920
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,780
at that moment who might physically have access
那一刻可能对你和你的第二个因素有物理访问权限的人。

921
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,020
to your person and your second factor, in this case.
在这种情况下，对你和你第二个因素有物理访问权限的人。

922
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,320
More technically, what those technologies do is they send you
更技术地说，这些技术做的是它们会向你发送

923
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,530
a one-time passcode, which is further secure because once it's used,
一个一次性密码，它更加安全，因为一旦使用，

924
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:50,520
there's hopefully some database that remembers that it has been used
希望有一些数据库会记住它已经被使用过

925
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,850
and cannot be used again.
并且不能再次使用。

926
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:54,570
So an adversary can't like sniff the airwaves and replay
所以，攻击者不能像嗅探无线电波那样，在下次它们确实到期时重复使用

927
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:57,250
that passcode the next time they, indeed, expire,
那个密码。

928
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:58,980
which adds some additional defense.
这增加了一些额外的防御。

929
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:02,130
And you might type it into a phone or maybe a web app that
你可能会将它输入手机，或者可能输入一个看起来像这样的网页应用。

930
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:04,840
looks a little something like this.
看起来像这样。

931
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:10,800
So passwords thus far, some defenses, therefore, any questions on this
所以，到目前为止的密码，一些防御，因此，关于这个机制，有什么问题吗？

932
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,250
here mechanism?
机制？

933
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:13,750
No?
没有？

934
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:15,640
All right, well, let's consider this.
好吧，让我们考虑一下。

935
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,090
Odds are, with some frequency, you forget these passwords, especially
很可能，你会经常忘记这些密码，尤其是在

936
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,800
if you're not using a password manager.
你不使用密码管理器的情况下。

937
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,633
And so you go to Gmail and you actually have
所以你进入 Gmail，你实际上拥有

938
00:45:22,633 --> 00:45:24,910
to click a link like this, Forgot Password.
点击像这样的链接，忘记密码。

939
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:28,630
And then it typically emails you to initiate
然后它通常会向你发送电子邮件，以启动

940
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,770
a process of resetting that password.
重置密码的过程。

941
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:35,110
But if you can recall, has anyone ever clicked a link like that
但是如果你能回忆起来，有人点击过这样的链接吗？

942
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:39,700
and then got an email with your password in the email?
然后收到了包含你的密码的电子邮件？

943
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,550
Maybe if you ever see this in the wild, that
也许如果你在现实生活中看到这种情况，那么

944
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:45,310
is to say in the real world, that is horrible, horrible design.
也就是说在现实世界中，这是一种糟糕的设计，非常糟糕。

945
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:45,820
Why?
为什么？

946
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:49,870
Because well-designed websites, not unlike CS50 Finance,
因为设计良好的网站，就像 CS50 Finance 一样，

947
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:53,440
which had a users table, should not be storing username-- rather,
它有一个用户表，不应该存储用户名——更确切地说，

948
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:59,650
should not be storing passwords in the clear, as it actually is.
不应该以明文形式存储密码，而实际上它就是这么做的。

949
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:02,170
It should somehow be obfuscated so that even
它应该以某种方式被混淆，即使

950
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:04,930
if your database from CS50 Finance or Google's database
你的 CS50 Finance 数据库或谷歌的数据库

951
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:08,020
is hacked and compromised and sold on the web,
被黑客入侵并被盗，并在网上出售，

952
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:10,570
it should not be as simple as doing like select star
它不应该像使用 select star 一样简单

953
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:14,500
from Account semicolon to see what your actual passwords are.
从 Account 表中查询，以查看你的实际密码。

954
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,140
And the mechanism that well-designed websites use
而设计良好的网站所使用的机制

955
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:20,020
is actually a primitive back from like week 5 when we
实际上是一种原始的技术，可以追溯到第 5 周，当时我们

956
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,120
talked about hashing and hash tables.
讨论了哈希和哈希表。

957
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,920
This time, we're using it for slightly different purposes.
这一次，我们将它用于略微不同的目的。

958
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:30,190
So in the world of passwords, on the server side, there's often a database
所以，在密码的世界中，在服务器端，通常有一个数据库

959
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:32,950
or maybe, more simply, a text file somewhere on the server
或者，更简单地说，在服务器上的某个地方有一个文本文件

960
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:35,050
that just associates usernames with passwords.
它只是将用户名与密码关联起来。

961
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:38,590
So to keep things simple, if there's at least two users like Alice and Bob,
为了简单起见，如果至少有两个用户，比如 Alice 和 Bob，

962
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,420
Alice's password is maybe apple.
Alice 的密码可能是 apple。

963
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,960
Bob's password is maybe banana, just to keep the mnemonics kind of simple.
Bob 的密码可能是 banana，只是为了让助记符尽可能简单。

964
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,930
If though that were the case on the server
如果服务器上的情况确实如此

965
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:49,630
and that server is compromised, whoever the hacker now
而且服务器被入侵了，现在无论是谁入侵了服务器

966
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:53,290
has access to every username and every password, which in and of itself
都可以访问每个用户名和每个密码，这本身

967
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:57,700
might not be a huge deal because maybe the server administrators can just
可能不是什么大问题，因为服务器管理员可以

968
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,730
disable all of the accounts, make everyone change their password,
禁用所有帐户，让每个人更改他们的密码，

969
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:01,880
and move on.
然后继续。

970
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,080
But there's also this attack known as password stuffing, which
但也有一种被称为密码填充的攻击，它

971
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:08,427
is a weirdly technical term, which means when you compromise one database,
是一个奇怪的技术术语，意思是当你入侵了一个数据库，

972
00:47:08,427 --> 00:47:09,010
you know what?
你知道吗？

973
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:12,260
Take advantage of the naivety of a lot of us users.
利用我们很多用户的天真。

974
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:15,440
Try the compromised Apple password, the banana
尝试被盗的 Apple 密码，香蕉

975
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,380
password not on the compromised website, but other websites
密码不在被盗的网站上，而是在其他网站上

976
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:21,290
that you and I might have access to, the presumption
你我可能可以访问的网站，假设

977
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:23,870
being that some of us in this room are using
是，我们房间里的一些人正在使用

978
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:25,950
the same passwords in multiple places.
同一个密码在多个地方。

979
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:28,970
So it's bad if your password is compromised on one server
所以，如果你的密码在一个服务器上被盗了

980
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:32,580
because, by transitivity, so can all of your other accounts be compromised.
那么，通过传递性，你所有的其他帐户也可能被入侵。

981
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,640
So in the world of hashing, this was the picture
所以，在哈希的世界中，这就是我们之前画的图

982
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:39,180
we drew some time ago, we can apply this same logic whereby, mathematically,
我们之前画的图，我们可以应用同样的逻辑，从数学上来说，

983
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,170
a hash function is like some function F and the input is X
一个哈希函数就像某个函数 F，输入是 X

984
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:44,150
and the output or the range is F of X. That
输出或范围是 F(X)。那

985
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:46,400
was sort of the fancy way of describing mathematically
是一种用数学方法描述哈希过程的奇特方式

986
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,860
hashing as a process weeks ago.
作为几周前的过程。

987
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,800
But here, at a simpler level, the input to this process
但是在这里，在一个更简单的层面上，这个过程的输入

988
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,420
is going to be your actual password.
将是你的实际密码。

989
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:56,630
The output is going to be a hash value, which in week 5
输出将是一个哈希值，在第 5 周

990
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:58,730
was something simple generally like a number--
通常是一个简单的东西，比如一个数字——

991
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:01,730
1 or 2 or 3 based on the first letter.
1 或 2 或 3，取决于第一个字母。

992
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:04,745
That's not going to be quite as naive an approach as we
那不会像我们所采用的那样天真。

993
00:48:04,745 --> 00:48:05,870
take in the password world.
在密码世界中。

994
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:07,578
It's going to look a little more cryptic.
它看起来会更神秘。

995
00:48:07,578 --> 00:48:11,570
So Apple weeks ago might have just been 1, banana might have been 3.
所以几周前的 Apple 可能是 1，banana 可能是 3。

996
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:15,980
But now let me propose that in the world of real world system design, what
但是现在让我提出，在现实世界系统设计的领域中，

997
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,140
the database people should actually store
数据库人员实际上应该存储的

998
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:21,252
is not apple, but rather this cryptic value.
不是 apple，而是这个神秘的值。

999
00:48:21,252 --> 00:48:23,960
And you can think of this as sort of random, but it's not random.
你可以把它想象成某种随机的东西，但它不是随机的。

1000
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,793
Because it is the result of an algorithm, some mathematical function
因为它是一个算法的结果，某个数学函数

1001
00:48:26,793 --> 00:48:29,360
that someone implemented and smart people evaluated and said,
有人实现了它，聪明人评估了它，并说，

1002
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,330
yes, this seems to be secure, secure in the sense
是的，这似乎是安全的，安全的意义在于

1003
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:34,740
that this hash function is meant to be one way.
这个哈希函数是单向的。

1004
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:37,640
So this is not encryption, a la Caesar Cipher from weeks
所以这不是加密，比如几周前的凯撒密码

1005
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:42,170
ago whereby you could just add 1 to encrypt and subtract 1 to decrypt.
之前，你只需加 1 来加密，减 1 来解密。

1006
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,930
This is one way in the sense that given this value,
这是单向的，因为给定这个值，

1007
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:49,190
it should be pretty much impossible mathematically to reverse the process
从数学上来说，逆转这个过程几乎是不可能的

1008
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:53,150
and figure out that the user's password was originally apple.
并找出用户的密码最初是 apple。

1009
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:57,372
Meanwhile banana, back in week 5 for simplicity, for hashing into a table,
同时，banana，回到第 5 周，为了简单起见，为了将其哈希到一个表中，

1010
00:48:57,372 --> 00:48:59,330
we might have had a simple output of 2, since B
我们可能得到一个简单的输出 2，因为 B

1011
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:01,205
is the second letter of the English alphabet.
是英语字母表中的第二个字母。

1012
00:49:01,205 --> 00:49:05,420
But now the hash value of banana, thanks to a fancier mathematical function,
但现在，banana 的哈希值，由于更复杂的数学函数，

1013
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,070
is actually going to be something more cryptic like this.
实际上将是一个更神秘的东西，像这样。

1014
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:12,470
And so what the server really does is store not apple and banana, but rather
所以服务器实际上存储的不是 apple 和 banana，而是

1015
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:15,770
those two seemingly cryptic values.
这两个看起来很神秘的值。

1016
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:19,460
And then when the human, be it Alice or Bob,
然后，当人类，无论是 Alice 还是 Bob，

1017
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:24,320
logs in to a web form with their actual username and password, like Alice,
登录到一个带有其真实用户名和密码的网页表单，比如 Alice，

1018
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,130
apple, Bob, banana, the website no longer even
apple，Bob，banana，网站不再

1019
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:32,210
knows that Alice's password is apple and that Bob's is banana.
知道 Alice 的密码是 apple，Bob 的密码是 banana。

1020
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:33,170
But that's OK.
但没关系。

1021
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:36,800
Because so long as the server uses the same code
因为只要服务器使用与

1022
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,760
as it was using when these folks registered for accounts,
这些人注册帐户时所使用的代码相同，

1023
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,460
Alice can type in apple, hit Enter, send it via HTTP to the server.
Alice 可以输入 apple，按回车键，通过 HTTP 发送到服务器。

1024
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,720
The server can run that same hash function on A-P-P-L-E.
服务器可以对 A-P-P-L-E 运行相同的哈希函数。

1025
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:51,590
And if the value matches, it can conclude with high probability, yes,
如果值匹配，它可以以很高的概率得出结论，是的，

1026
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:55,760
this is in fact, the original Alice or this, in fact, is the original Bob.
这实际上是最初的 Alice，或者实际上是最初的 Bob。

1027
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,470
So the server never saves the password, but it does use the same hash function
所以服务器从不保存密码，但它确实使用了相同的哈希函数

1028
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:05,660
to compare those same hash values again and again whenever these folks log in
每次这些用户登录时，都要不断比较相同的哈希值

1029
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:06,650
again and again.
一次又一次

1030
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:11,390
So, in reality, here's a simple one-way hash for both Alice's
所以，实际上，这里有一个简单的一路哈希值，用于 Alice 的

1031
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:13,310
and Bob's passwords in the real world.
以及 Bob 在现实世界中的密码

1032
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:15,560
It's even longer, this is to say, than what I
它更长，也就是说，比我

1033
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,600
used as shorter examples a moment ago.
刚才用作较短示例的还要长

1034
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,460
But there is a corner case here.
但是这里有一个特殊情况

1035
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:23,400
Suppose that an adversary is smart and has some free time
假设攻击者很聪明，而且有一些空闲时间

1036
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,150
and isn't necessarily interested in getting into someone's account
并且不一定要立即进入别人的账户

1037
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:28,730
right now, but wants to do a bit of prework
而是想做一些预备工作

1038
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:31,910
to decrease the future cost of getting into someone's account.
以便降低未来进入别人账户的成本

1039
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:34,410
There is a technical term known as a rainbow table,
有一个技术术语叫做彩虹表

1040
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:38,030
which is essentially like a dictionary in the Python sense or the SQL sense,
本质上就像 Python 或 SQL 中的字典

1041
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:43,790
whereby in advance an adversary could just try hashing all of the fruits
因此，攻击者可以提前尝试对所有水果进行哈希运算

1042
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:47,090
of the world or, really, all of the English words of the world or, rather,
全世界或所有英文单词，或者说

1043
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:51,470
all possible four-digit, four-character, eight-character passcodes in advance
提前所有可能的四位数、四字符和八字符密码

1044
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:53,870
and just store them in two columns--
并将其存储在两列中

1045
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:57,260
the password, like 0000 or apple or banana,
密码，比如 0000、apple 或 banana

1046
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,760
and then just store in advance the hash values.
然后提前存储哈希值

1047
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,280
So the adversary could effectively reverse engineer the hash
所以攻击者可以有效地逆向破解哈希值

1048
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:09,440
by just looking at a hash, comparing it against its massive database of hashes,
只需查看哈希值，将其与庞大的哈希值数据库进行比较

1049
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,060
and figuring out what password originally correspond to that.
并找出最初与之对应的密码

1050
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:17,540
Why then is this still relatively safe?
为什么这仍然相对安全？

1051
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,760
Rainbow tables are concerning.
彩虹表令人担忧

1052
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,480
But they don't defeat passwords altogether.
但它们不会完全破解密码

1053
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,740
Why might that be?
为什么呢？

1054
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,400
Yeah.
是的

1055
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
观众：[听不清]

1056
00:51:31,948 --> 00:51:33,740
DAVID MALAN: OK, so the adversary might not
DAVID MALAN：好的，所以攻击者可能不会

1057
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,948
know exactly what hash function the company is using.
知道公司使用的哈希函数的具体内容

1058
00:51:35,948 --> 00:51:39,560
Generally speaking, you would not want to necessarily keep that private.
一般来说，你不会想要将其保密

1059
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,960
That would be considered security through obscurity.
这将被视为通过模糊性来实现安全性

1060
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,440
And all it takes is like one bad actor to tell the adversary what
而且只需要一个坏人告诉攻击者

1061
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,340
hash function is being used.
使用的哈希函数是什么

1062
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,500
And then that would put your security more at risk.
然后你的安全就会面临更大的风险

1063
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,710
So generally in the security world, openness
所以，在安全界，开放性

1064
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:53,750
when it comes to the algorithms in process
对于算法而言

1065
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:55,400
is generally considered best practice.
通常被认为是最佳实践

1066
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,760
And the reality is, there's a few popular hash functions out there
现实是，有一些流行的哈希函数

1067
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,990
that any company should be using.
任何公司都应该使用

1068
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:03,950
And so it's not really keeping a secret anyway.
所以，无论如何，它并不是真正保密

1069
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:05,010
But other thoughts?
还有其他想法吗？

1070
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:07,190
Why is this rainbow table not such a concern?
为什么彩虹表不是那么令人担忧？

1071
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,883
AUDIENCE: It takes a lot longer for the [INAUDIBLE]..
观众：这需要花费攻击者更长的时间 [听不清]

1072
00:52:09,883 --> 00:52:12,050
DAVID MALAN: It takes a lot longer for the adversary
DAVID MALAN：这需要花费攻击者更长的时间

1073
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:15,020
to access that information because this table could get long.
来访问这些信息，因为这个表可能会变得很长

1074
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:18,440
And even more along those lines-- anyone want to push a little harder?
还有，还有没有其他想法？

1075
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,460
This doesn't necessarily put all of our passwords at risk.
这并不一定会让所有密码面临风险

1076
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:25,110
It easily puts our four-digit passcodes at risk.
这很容易让我们的四位数密码面临风险

1077
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:25,610
Why?
为什么？

1078
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:28,575
Because this table, this dictionary would have, what, 10,000 rows?
因为这个表，这个字典会包含多少行？10,000 行？

1079
00:52:28,575 --> 00:52:30,950
And we've seen that you can search that kind of like that
我们已经看到，你可以像这样搜索它

1080
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:33,020
or even regenerate all of the possible values.
甚至重新生成所有可能的值

1081
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:36,200
But once you get to eight-character passcodes,
但一旦你使用八字符密码

1082
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,510
I said it was 4 quadrillion possibilities.
我说过，它有 4 千万亿种可能性

1083
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:42,652
That's a crazy big dictionary in Python or crazy big list
这在 Python 中是一个非常大的字典或列表

1084
00:52:42,652 --> 00:52:43,610
of some sort in Python.
在 Python 中

1085
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:48,350
That's just way more RAM or memory than a typical adversary is going to have.
这比一般攻击者拥有的 RAM 或内存要多得多

1086
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:51,350
Now, maybe if it's a particularly resourced adversary like a government,
现在，如果是一个拥有大量资源的攻击者，比如政府

1087
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:54,140
a state more generally, maybe they do have supercomputers
更一般地说，国家，也许他们确实拥有超级计算机

1088
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:55,730
that can fit that much information.
可以容纳那么多的信息

1089
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:58,160
But, fine, then use a 16-character passcode
但是，好吧，那么使用一个 16 字符密码

1090
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,070
and make it an unpronounceable long search space
并将其设置为一个不可读的较长的搜索空间

1091
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:02,780
that's way bigger than 4 quadrillion.
比 4 千万亿还要大得多

1092
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:07,820
So it's a threat, but only if you're on that horrible top 10 list or top 100
所以它是一种威胁，但只有当你使用那些糟糕的排名前 10 位或排名前 100 位

1093
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:11,470
or short passcode list that we've discussed thus far.
或较短的密码列表，这些我们之前已经讨论过了

1094
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:14,490
So here's though a related threat that's just worth knowing about.
所以这里有一个相关的威胁，值得了解

1095
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:15,930
What's problematic here?
这里有什么问题？

1096
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:18,570
If we introduce two more users, Carol and Charlie,
如果我们再引入两个用户，Carol 和 Charlie

1097
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:23,370
and just for the semantics of it, whose password happened to be cherry.
为了语义，他们的密码恰好是 cherry

1098
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:28,140
What if they both happened to have the same password and this database
如果他们两个恰好拥有相同的密码，而且这个数据库

1099
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:28,860
is compromised?
被攻破了？

1100
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:29,910
Some hacker gets in.
一些黑客入侵了

1101
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:33,810
And just to be clear, we wouldn't be storing apple, banana, cherry, cherry.
明确地说，我们不会存储 apple、banana、cherry、cherry

1102
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:37,380
We'd still be storing, according to this story, these hashes.
我们仍然会存储，根据这个故事，这些哈希值

1103
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,080
But why is this still concerning?
但为什么这仍然令人担忧？

1104
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,335
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
观众：[听不清]

1105
00:53:44,435 --> 00:53:45,310
DAVID MALAN: Exactly.
DAVID MALAN：没错

1106
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:47,852
If you figure out just one of them, now you've got the other.
如果你破解了一个，那么你就得到了另一个

1107
00:53:47,852 --> 00:53:50,410
And this is, in some sense, just leaking information, right?
从某种意义上说，这只是信息泄露，对吧？

1108
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:53,330
I don't maybe at a glance what I could do with this information.
我可能无法一眼看出我能用这些信息做什么

1109
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:56,562
But if Carol and Charlie have the same password, you know what?
但如果 Carol 和 Charlie 拥有相同的密码，你知道吗？

1110
00:53:56,562 --> 00:53:59,020
I bet they have the same password on other systems as well.
我敢打赌，他们可能在其他系统中也拥有相同的密码

1111
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:02,300
You're leaking information that just does no good for anyone.
你泄露了对任何人都没有好处的信息

1112
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,460
So how can we avoid that?
那么如何避免这种情况呢？

1113
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:07,127
Well, we probably don't want to force Carol or Charlie to change
好吧，我们可能不想强迫 Carol 或 Charlie 更改

1114
00:54:07,127 --> 00:54:09,293
their password, especially when they're registering.
他们的密码，尤其是在他们注册的时候

1115
00:54:09,293 --> 00:54:12,760
You definitely don't want to say, sorry, someone's already using that password,
你绝对不想说，对不起，有人已经在使用那个密码了

1116
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,900
you can't use it as well.
你也不能使用

1117
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,820
Because that too would leak information.
因为那样也会泄露信息

1118
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:19,600
But there's this technique in computing known as salting
但是，在计算中有一种叫做加盐的技术

1119
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,460
whereby we can do this instead.
我们可以用它来代替

1120
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:26,530
If cherry we in this scheme hashes to a value like this, you know what?
如果 cherry 在这个方案中被哈希成这样的值，你知道吗？

1121
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:29,620
Let's go ahead and sprinkle a little bit of salt into the process.
让我们在过程中撒点盐。

1122
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:33,220
And it's sort of a metaphorical salt whereby this hash function now takes
这是一种比喻性的盐，这个哈希函数现在需要

1123
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:36,760
two inputs, not just the password, but some other value known as a salt.
两个输入，不仅仅是密码，还有另一个称为盐的值。

1124
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:40,450
And the salt can be generally something super short like two characters even,
盐通常可以是超短的，甚至只有两个字符，

1125
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:41,620
or something longer.
或更长。

1126
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,960
And the idea is that this salt, much like a recipe,
这个盐的想法，就像一个食谱一样，

1127
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,250
should of perturb the output a little bit,
应该会稍微扰乱输出，

1128
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,630
make it taste a little bit differently, if you will.
如果你愿意，让它尝起来有点不同。

1129
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:54,050
And so concretely, if we take the word cherry and then when Carol registers,
因此具体地说，如果我们取单词 "cherry"，然后当 Carol 注册时，

1130
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:58,490
for instance, we randomly choose a salt of 50, 5-0, so two characters,
例如，我们随机选择一个盐 50，5-0，也就是两个字符，

1131
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:01,310
the hash value now-- because there's two inputs--
哈希值现在，因为有两个输入，

1132
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:02,820
might now be this value.
现在可能是这个值。

1133
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:07,040
But if for Charlie, we still have cherry, but we change the 50,
但是如果对于 Charlie 来说，我们仍然有 "cherry"，但是我们改变了 50，

1134
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,420
we might see this instead.
我们可能会看到这个。

1135
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:11,570
Notice that for this first example, Carol, 50,
注意，对于第一个例子，Carol，50，

1136
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:14,815
the salt is preserved in the hash value, just so you know what it was
盐被保留在哈希值中，这样你就能知道它是什么

1137
00:55:14,815 --> 00:55:17,690
and you can sprinkle the same amount of salt, so to speak, next time.
下次你可以撒同样量的盐，这么说吧。

1138
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:21,260
But that's the whole hash value for Carol in this case.
但那是这个例子中 Carol 的整个哈希值。

1139
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:26,360
But if Charlie also has a password of cherry, but we change the salt to,
但是如果 Charlie 也有一个密码是 "cherry"，但是我们把盐改成，

1140
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:31,500
say, 49 arbitrarily, that whole hash value changed.
比如，任意地改为 49，整个哈希值就改变了。

1141
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,720
And so now in my hash database, I'm going to see different salts there,
所以现在在我的哈希数据库中，我会看到不同的盐，

1142
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:39,410
different values, which is going to effectively cover up the fact
不同的值，这将有效地掩盖这样一个事实，

1143
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:41,580
that Carol and Charlie have the same password.
Carol 和 Charlie 有相同的密码。

1144
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:45,075
Now, if we have so many users that we run out of salts,
现在，如果我们有太多用户以至于我们用完盐了，

1145
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:46,700
that still might leak some information.
这仍然可能会泄露一些信息。

1146
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:50,000
But that's kind of a we can kick down the road and probabilistically not
但这是一种我们可以拖延下去的事情，从概率上来说不会

1147
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,900
going to happen if you require passwords of sufficiently long length, most
发生，如果你要求密码足够长，大多数

1148
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:54,800
likely.
可能。

1149
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:58,880
So any questions on salting, which to be clear,
所以，关于加盐，说清楚一点，

1150
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,190
is just a mechanism for decreasing the probability
只是一个降低概率的机制，

1151
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:03,650
that an adversary is going to glean information
对手获取信息的概率

1152
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:08,090
that you might not want them to have?
你可能不希望他们拥有的信息？

1153
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:09,880
So what does this mean concretely?
那么，这在具体上意味着什么？

1154
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:13,060
When you get an email from a website saying "click this link
当你收到来自网站的电子邮件说 "点击此链接

1155
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:16,730
to reset your password," it's not the website, if well designed,
重置你的密码"，如果网站设计良好，就不是网站，

1156
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:20,230
is being difficult or shy and not telling you your password,
很难或害羞，不告诉你你的密码，

1157
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:23,872
the web administrators just do not know, ideally, your password.
理想情况下，网站管理员根本不知道你的密码。

1158
00:56:23,872 --> 00:56:24,830
So what are they doing?
那么他们在做什么呢？

1159
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:27,160
They're probably sending you a link, similar in spirit
他们可能正在给你发送一个链接，在精神上类似

1160
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:31,000
to a one-time password, there's some random unique string in there
于一次性密码，里面有一些随机的唯一字符串，

1161
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,097
that's unique to you.
那是你独有的。

1162
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,680
They've stored that in their database.
他们已经将它存储在他们的数据库中。

1163
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,305
So as soon as you click on that link, they check their database
所以，当你点击那个链接时，他们会查看他们的数据库

1164
00:56:36,305 --> 00:56:39,760
and be like, oh, wait a minute, I know I set this link a minute ago to David.
然后就会说，哦，等等，我知道我几分钟前将这个链接设置给了 David。

1165
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,000
Let me just trust now-- because probabilistically there's no way
让我现在就信任一下，因为从概率上来说，不可能

1166
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,580
someone guessed this URL within 60 seconds--
有人能在 60 秒内猜到这个 URL。

1167
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:48,520
let's trust that whatever he wants to type in as his new password
让我们相信，无论他想要输入什么作为他的新密码

1168
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,940
should be associated with that Malan account in the database.
都应该与数据库中的那个 Malan 账户关联。

1169
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:56,380
But if, conversely, you ever get an email saying your password is 123456
但是，反过来，如果你曾经收到过一封电子邮件，说你的密码是 123456

1170
00:56:56,380 --> 00:57:00,970
or whatever it is, it is clearly not being hashed, let alone salted,
或任何其他密码，它显然没有被哈希，更不用说加盐了，

1171
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:01,910
on the server.
在服务器上。

1172
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:06,100
And that is not a website to do anything particularly sensitive with.
那不是一个可以做任何特别敏感事情的网站。

1173
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,730
All right, so what more can we do?
好的，那么我们还能做什么呢？

1174
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:12,960
Well, let's pick up where we left off in week two on the art of cryptography,
好吧，让我们从第二周关于密码术的艺术中继续，

1175
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,090
this art, the science of scrambling information, but in a reversible way.
这种艺术，对信息进行加密的科学，但它是可逆的。

1176
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:22,273
So whereas hashing, as we've described it here, is really tends to be one-way,
所以，就像我们在这里描述的那样，哈希实际上倾向于单向，

1177
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:25,190
whereby you should not be able to reverse the process unless you cheat
除非你作弊，否则你应该无法逆转这个过程，

1178
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:27,067
and make a massive table of all of the inputs
并制作一个包含所有输入的大型表格，

1179
00:57:27,067 --> 00:57:29,150
and all of the outputs, which isn't really so much
以及所有输出，这不像真正的

1180
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:31,880
reversing as it is just looking it up.
逆转，而是查找它。

1181
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,060
Cryptography, like in week 2, can actually
密码学，就像在第二周一样，实际上

1182
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:38,120
be a solution to a lot of problems, not just sending messages
可以解决很多问题，不仅仅是发送信息

1183
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,740
across a crowded room.
穿过拥挤的房间。

1184
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:43,760
We, weeks ago, really focused on this type of cryptography
几周前，我们真正关注这种类型的密码学，

1185
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,800
whereby you've got some plain text message.
你有明文信息。

1186
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:50,060
You've got a key, like a secret number 1 or 13 or something else.
你有一个密钥，就像一个秘密数字 1 或 13 或其他东西。

1187
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:54,500
The cipher, which might be a rotational cipher or a substitution cipher,
密码，可能是轮转密码或替换密码，

1188
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,897
some algorithm, and then ciphertext was the term
某些算法，然后密文是描述加密版本的术语。

1189
00:57:56,897 --> 00:57:58,730
of art for describing the scrambled version.
艺术。

1190
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:01,190
That should look like random zeros and ones or letters
它应该看起来像随机的 0 和 1 或字母

1191
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:02,570
of the alphabet or the like.
或类似的东西。

1192
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:06,880
This though was reversible, whereby you could just
不过，它是可逆的，你可以直接

1193
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,513
input the ciphertext with the key and get back out the plain text.
输入密文和密钥，并得到明文。

1194
00:58:10,513 --> 00:58:13,180
Maybe you have to change a positive number to a negative number.
可能你需要将一个正数改为负数。

1195
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,680
But the key is really the same.
但密钥实际上是相同的。

1196
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:19,165
Be it plus 1 minus 1 or plus 13 minus 13, the process was symmetric.
无论是加 1 减 1 还是加 13 减 13，这个过程都是对称的。

1197
00:58:19,165 --> 00:58:21,040
And, indeed, what we talked about in week two
实际上，我们在第二周讨论的是

1198
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,310
was an example of something called secret key cryptography, where
称为对称密钥密码学的东西的例子，在那里

1199
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:27,610
there's, indeed, one secret between two parties, a.k.a.
确实，两个参与方之间有一个秘密，也就是

1200
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:29,350
symmetric cryptography.
对称密码学。

1201
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:32,770
Because encryption is pretty much the same as decryption, but maybe
因为加密和解密几乎相同，但可能

1202
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:36,160
you change the sign on the key itself.
你需要改变密钥本身的符号。

1203
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,470
But this is not necessarily all we want.
但这不是我们想要的全部。

1204
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:40,970
Because here's that general process.
因为这是通用的过程。

1205
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:42,678
Here's the letter A. Here's the key of 1.
这是字母 A，这是密钥 1。

1206
00:58:42,678 --> 00:58:46,360
We outputed in week 2 a value of B. That's not necessarily
我们在第二周输出的值是 B，这并不一定是

1207
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,960
the solution to all of our problems.
所有问题的解决方案。

1208
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:48,460
Why?
为什么？

1209
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:52,652
Well, if two people want to communicate securely, they need some shared secret.
好吧，如果两个人想要安全地交流，他们需要一些共同的秘密。

1210
00:58:52,652 --> 00:58:55,360
So, for instance, if I wanted to send a secret message to Rongxin
所以，例如，如果我想给 Rongxin 发送一条秘密信息，

1211
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,970
in the back of the room here, he and I have better
在房间的后面，我和他事先就达成了一致。

1212
00:58:57,970 --> 00:59:00,050
agreed upon a secret in advance.
我们事先就达成了一致。

1213
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:03,460
Otherwise, how can I possibly send a message, encrypt it in a way
否则，我怎么才能发送一条消息，并以一种方式对其进行加密

1214
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:04,462
that he can reverse?
他能逆转？

1215
00:59:04,462 --> 00:59:06,920
I mean, I could be like, (WHISPERING) let's use a key of 1.
我的意思是，我可以说，（低声）让我们使用一个密钥为 1。

1216
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,510
(SPEAKING NORMALLY) But obviously, anyone in the middle
（正常说话）但显然，中间的任何人

1217
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:09,530
has just now heard that.
刚刚就听到了。

1218
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:11,790
So we might as well not communicate securely at all.
所以我们最好不要进行安全的通信。

1219
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:13,760
So there's this kind of chicken-and-the-egg problem,
所以存在着这样的一个先有鸡还是先有蛋的问题，

1220
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,140
not just contrived here in lecture.
这不仅仅是在课堂上编造的。

1221
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:17,473
But the first time I want to buy something on amazon.com
但当我第一次想在 amazon.com 上买东西的时候

1222
00:59:17,473 --> 00:59:20,270
with my credit card, I would like my credit card to be encrypted,
用我的信用卡，我希望我的信用卡被加密，

1223
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:21,360
scrambled somehow.
以某种方式被混淆。

1224
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:24,380
But I don't know anyone personally at amazon.com, let alone someone
但我并不认识 amazon.com 的任何人，更不用说

1225
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:28,730
that I've prearranged some secret for my Mac and their servers.
我事先为我的 Mac 和他们的服务器预先安排了一些秘密。

1226
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:33,200
So it seems that we fundamentally can't use symmetric cryptography
所以看来我们不能从根本上使用对称加密

1227
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,370
all of the time, unless we have some other mechanism for securely generating
一直使用，除非我们有其他机制来安全地生成

1228
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:41,270
that key, which we don't have as the common case in the world today.
那个密钥，而我们现在还没有像当今世界普遍存在的那样。

1229
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:43,550
Thankfully, mathematicians years ago came up
值得庆幸的是，几年前的数学家就想出了

1230
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:46,820
with something known as asymmetric cryptography, which
一种被称为非对称加密的东西，它

1231
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:50,250
does not require that you use the same secret in both directions.
不需要你在两个方向上使用相同的密钥。

1232
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:53,330
This is otherwise known as public key cryptography.
这也被称为公钥加密。

1233
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:56,010
And it works essentially as follows.
它的工作原理基本上如下。

1234
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:59,330
When you want to take some plaintext message and encrypt it,
当你想取一些明文消息并对其进行加密时，

1235
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:02,430
you use the recipient's public key.
你使用接收者的公钥。

1236
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:06,080
So if Rongxin is my colleague in back and he has a public key,
所以如果荣鑫是我的同事，他有一个公钥，

1237
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,280
it is public by definition.
根据定义，它是公开的。

1238
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,680
He can literally shout for the whole room
他可以大声地喊，让整个房间

1239
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,290
to hear what his public key is, which effectively is just
听到他的公钥是什么，它实际上就是

1240
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:14,578
some big, seemingly random number.
一个大而看似随机的数字。

1241
01:00:14,578 --> 01:00:16,620
But there's some mathematical significance of it.
但它有一些数学意义。

1242
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:17,703
And I can write that down.
我可以把它写下来。

1243
01:00:17,703 --> 01:00:21,290
Heck, you can all write it down if you too want to send him secure messages.
哎呀，如果你想给他发送安全消息，你们都可以写下来。

1244
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:24,057
And out of those two inputs, we get one output, the ciphertext,
从这两个输入中，我们得到一个输出，即密文，

1245
01:00:24,057 --> 01:00:27,140
that I can then hand off to people in the room in those virtual envelopes.
然后我可以把它交给房间里的人，放在那些虚拟信封里。

1246
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:29,720
And it doesn't matter if all of you have heard his public key.
而且，你们是否听到过他的公钥并不重要。

1247
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,803
Because you can perhaps guess where this is going.
因为你可能猜到这将走向何方。

1248
01:00:31,803 --> 01:00:34,230
How would Rongxin reverse this process?
荣鑫将如何逆转这个过程？

1249
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:36,560
He's not going to use one public key.
他不会使用一个公钥。

1250
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:40,980
He's going to use, not surprisingly, a corresponding private key.
不出所料，他将使用一个相应的私钥。

1251
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:44,900
And so in asymmetric cryptography or public key cryptography,
因此，在非对称加密或公钥加密中，

1252
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:48,377
you really have a key pair, a public key and a private key.
你实际上拥有一对密钥，一个公钥和一个私钥。

1253
01:00:48,377 --> 01:00:50,210
And for our mathematical purposes today, let
为了我们今天数学上的目的，让我们

1254
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:53,060
me just stipulate that there's some fancy math involved, such
规定，其中涉及一些复杂的数学，例如

1255
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:56,390
that when you choose that key or, really, those keys,
当你选择那个密钥，或者实际上是那些密钥时，

1256
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:59,000
there's a mathematical relationship between them.
它们之间存在着数学关系。

1257
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,760
And knowing one does not really give you any information about the other.
而知道一个并不能真正告诉你关于另一个的任何信息。

1258
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:03,260
Why?
为什么？

1259
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:06,920
Because these numbers are so darn big it would take adversaries more
因为这些数字非常大，敌对方需要更多的时间

1260
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,640
time than we all have on Earth to figure out via brute force
比我们所有人在地球上的时间还要多，才能通过暴力破解的方式

1261
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,710
what the corresponding private key is.
找出相应的私钥。

1262
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:13,850
The math is that good.
数学就是这么好。

1263
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:15,770
And even as computers get faster, we just
即使计算机越来越快，我们也只是一直

1264
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:18,500
keep using bigger and bigger keys, more and more bits
使用越来越大的密钥，越来越多的位

1265
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,900
to make the math even harder for adversaries.
让敌对方更难进行数学运算。

1266
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:24,830
So when Rongxin receives that message, he uses his private key,
所以当荣鑫收到那条消息时，他使用他的私钥，

1267
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:27,230
takes the ciphertext I sent him through the room,
取回我通过房间发送给他的密文，

1268
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:29,310
and gets back out the plaintext.
并得到明文。

1269
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:33,530
So this is exactly how HTTPS works effectively
所以这正是 HTTPS 如何有效地工作的

1270
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:38,030
to securely establish a channel between me and Amazon.com, gmail.com.
来在我和 Amazon.com、gmail.com 之间安全地建立一个通道。

1271
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:44,120
Any website starting with https:// uses public key cryptography to come up
任何以 https:// 开头的网站都使用公钥加密来

1272
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,650
with, initially, a secret.
产生一个最初的密钥。

1273
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:47,780
And in practice, it turns out, mathematically,
在实践中，从数学上讲，

1274
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:49,970
it's faster to use secret key crypto.
使用密钥加密速度更快。

1275
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:53,000
So very often, people will use asymmetric crypto
所以，人们经常使用非对称加密

1276
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,350
to generate a big shared key and then use the faster algorithms thereafter.
来生成一个大的共享密钥，然后使用更快的算法。

1277
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:59,900
But it does solve asymmetric cryptography,
但它确实解决了非对称加密，

1278
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:03,780
that chicken-and-the-egg problem, by giving us all public keys and private
那个先有鸡还是先有蛋的问题，通过为我们提供所有公钥和私钥

1279
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:04,280
keys.
密钥。

1280
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:07,312
If you've heard of RSA, Diffie-Hellman, elliptic curve cryptography,
如果你听说过 RSA、Diffie-Hellman、椭圆曲线加密，

1281
01:02:07,312 --> 01:02:09,770
there's different algorithms for this that you can actually
有不同的算法，你实际上可以

1282
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:12,030
study in higher level, more theoretical classes.
在更高级、更理论的课程中学习。

1283
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:15,155
But there's a bunch of different ways mathematically to solve this problem.
但从数学上讲，有很多不同的方法来解决这个问题。

1284
01:02:15,155 --> 01:02:17,750
But those are the primitives involved.
但那些是所涉及的原始概念。

1285
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:20,780
And how many of you have heard of now passkeys, which
你们中有多少人听说过现在的通行证，它

1286
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:23,960
is kind of only just catching on in recent months, literally.
实际上，最近几个月才开始流行起来。

1287
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,450
If I had to make any prediction this semester,
如果我必须在本学期做出任何预测，

1288
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:29,460
odds are, you're going to see these in more and more places.
很有可能，你会在越来越多的场合看到它们。

1289
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:32,720
And in fact, the next time you register for a website or log into a website,
事实上，下次你注册网站或登录网站时，

1290
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:37,730
look for a link, a button that maybe doesn't say passkeys, per se.
寻找一个链接，一个按钮，它可能不叫通行证，而是叫别的东西。

1291
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:40,190
It's often called passwordless login.
它通常被称为无密码登录。

1292
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:42,200
But it's really referring to the same thing.
但这实际上指的是同一件事。

1293
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:46,410
Passkeys are essentially a newish feature of operating systems,
通行证本质上是操作系统的一种新功能，

1294
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:50,630
be it Mac OS or Windows or Linux or the OS running on your phone,
无论是 Mac OS、Windows、Linux 还是手机上的操作系统，

1295
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:54,380
that doesn't require that you choose a username and password anymore.
它不再要求你选择用户名和密码。

1296
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:56,990
Rather, when you visit a website for the very first time,
相反，当你第一次访问一个网站时，

1297
01:02:56,990 --> 01:03:01,610
your device will generate a public and private key pair.
你的设备将生成一对公钥和私钥。

1298
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:04,270
Your device will then send to the website for what
你的设备会将你的公钥发送给网站，以便它拥有其中一个值，

1299
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:09,100
you're registering your public key so that it has one of the values,
但你保留你的私钥，确实是私有的。

1300
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:12,010
but you keep your private key, indeed, private.
但你保留你的私钥，确实是私有的。

1301
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:15,760
And using the same mathematical process that I alluded to earlier,
使用我和之前提到的相同的数学过程，

1302
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,790
you can therefore log into that website in the future
因此，将来你可以登录该网站

1303
01:03:18,790 --> 01:03:21,880
by proving mathematically that you are, in fact, the owner
通过数学证明你确实是所有者

1304
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,230
of the corresponding private key.
对应的私钥

1305
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:26,530
So, in essence, if we use a picture like this,
所以，本质上，如果我们使用这样的图片

1306
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:30,130
when you proceed to log in to that website again-- and, again,
当你再次登录该网站时，再次

1307
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:32,022
that website has stored your public key--
该网站存储了你的公钥

1308
01:03:32,022 --> 01:03:34,480
it essentially uses something known as digital signatures--
它本质上使用了一种称为数字签名的技术

1309
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,060
you're familiar with this term, you've heard it in the wild--
你熟悉这个词，你曾在现实中听说过

1310
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:40,810
whereby the website will send you a challenge message,
该网站会向你发送一条挑战信息

1311
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:43,540
like some random number or string of text.
比如一个随机数或一段文本

1312
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:45,340
It's just some random value.
它只是一个随机值

1313
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:49,690
If you then effectively encrypt it with your private key or run both of those
然后，你用你的私钥加密它，或者将两者都运行

1314
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:52,750
through a particular algorithm, you'll get back a signature.
通过特定的算法，你将获得一个签名

1315
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:57,200
And that signature can be verified by the website by using your public key.
该网站可以使用你的公钥来验证该签名

1316
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,330
So digital signatures are kind of an application of cryptography
所以，数字签名是密码学的一种应用

1317
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:03,040
but in the reverse direction.
但是方向相反

1318
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:06,010
In the world of encryption, you use someone's public key
在加密的世界里，你使用某人的公钥

1319
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:07,630
to send a message encrypted.
发送加密的信息

1320
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:09,910
And they use their private key to decrypt it.
他们使用自己的私钥来解密它

1321
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:12,220
In the world of signatures, or really passkeys,
在签名的世界里，或者说是密钥的世界里

1322
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:16,420
you reverse the process, whereby you use your private key to effectively encrypt
你颠倒了这个过程，你使用你的私钥来加密

1323
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:18,160
some random challenge you've been sent.
你收到的随机挑战

1324
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,980
And the website, the third party, can use your public key
该网站，第三方，可以使用你的公钥

1325
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:24,760
to verify, OK, mathematically, that response came from David.
验证，好的，从数学上来说，这个回复来自大卫

1326
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,740
Because I have his public key on file.
因为我有他的公钥

1327
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:28,000
So what's the upside of this?
那么，这样做有什么好处呢？

1328
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,060
We just get out of the business of passwords and password managers
我们就可以摆脱密码和密码管理器的烦恼

1329
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:31,930
more generally.
更普遍地说

1330
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:34,450
You do have to trust and protect your devices, be it
你确实需要信任和保护你的设备，无论是

1331
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:36,790
your phone or your laptop or desktop all the more.
你的手机，你的笔记本电脑，还是你的台式机

1332
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:39,190
And that's going to open another possible threat.
这将带来另一种潜在的威胁

1333
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:42,310
But this is a way to chip away at what is becoming the reality
但这是一种方法，可以逐渐摆脱我们正在面临的现实

1334
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:46,090
that you and I probably have dozens, hundreds of usernames and passwords
你和我都可能拥有几十个，甚至几百个用户名和密码

1335
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:48,350
that's probably not sustainable long-term.
从长远来看，这可能无法持续下去

1336
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:53,580
And, indeed, we read to often about hacks in the wild as a result.
事实上，我们经常看到有关网络攻击的报道

1337
01:04:53,580 --> 01:05:00,190
Questions then on cryptography or passkeys?
那么，关于密码学或密钥还有问题吗？

1338
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:03,370
All right, just a few more building blocks to equip you for the real world
好的，让我们再学习几个构建块，让你在现实世界中游刃有余

1339
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:07,360
before we sort of maybe do a final check for understanding of sorts.
在我们进行最终的理解检查之前

1340
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:11,990
So when it comes to encryption, we can solve other problems as well.
所以，谈到加密，我们还可以解决其他问题

1341
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:15,340
And in this too is a feature you should increasingly be seeking out.
这也有一个功能，你应该越来越重视它

1342
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:19,720
So end-to-end encryption refers to a stronger use of encryption
端到端加密指的是一种更强大的加密方式

1343
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,970
than most websites are actually in the habit of using.
比大多数网站实际使用的加密方式更强大

1344
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:25,960
Case in point, if you're using HTTPS to send an email to Gmail,
举个例子，如果你使用 HTTPS 发送电子邮件到 Gmail

1345
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:28,630
that's good because no one between you and Gmail servers
这是好的，因为你与 Gmail 服务器之间

1346
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:30,970
presumably can see the message because it's encrypted.
没有人可以看到邮件内容，因为它被加密了

1347
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:32,710
It just looks like random zeros and ones.
它看起来只是一堆随机的 0 和 1

1348
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:36,670
So it's effectively secure from people on the internet.
所以，它实际上可以防止网络上的人窥探

1349
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:41,140
The emails are not secure from like nosy employees at Google
但是，这些电子邮件无法防止 Google 好奇的员工窥探

1350
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:43,220
who do have access to those servers.
他们确实可以访问这些服务器

1351
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:46,855
Now, maybe through corporate policy, they shouldn't or physically don't.
当然，也许由于公司政策，他们不应该，或者实际上也不能访问

1352
01:05:46,855 --> 01:05:48,730
But, theoretically, there's someone at Google
但是，理论上，Google 的某个员工

1353
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:51,823
who could look at all of your email if they were so inclined.
如果他们愿意，就可以查看你所有的电子邮件

1354
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:53,740
Hopefully it's just not a long list of people.
希望这只是个小范围的人

1355
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:56,800
But end-to-end encryption ensures that if you're
但是，端到端加密确保，如果你

1356
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:00,830
sending a message from A to B, even if it's going through C in the middle--
从 A 发送信息到 B，即使它经过了中间的 C

1357
01:06:00,830 --> 01:06:03,950
be it Google or Microsoft or someone else-- end-to-end encryption
无论是 Google，还是 Microsoft，或者其他人，端到端加密

1358
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:08,300
means that you're encrypting it between A and B. And so even C in the middle
意味着你在 A 和 B 之间加密信息。因此，即使是中间的 C

1359
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,410
has no idea what's going on.
也不知道发生了什么

1360
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:12,830
This is not true of services like Gmail or Outlook.
像 Gmail 或者 Outlook 这样的服务就不是这样

1361
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:16,040
This is true of services like iMessage or WhatsApp
像 iMessage 或者 WhatsApp 这样的服务就是这样的

1362
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:20,060
or Signal or Telegram or other services where if you poke around, also
或者 Signal，Telegram，或者其他类似的服务，如果你仔细研究，你也会看到

1363
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:22,735
you'll see literally mention of end-to-end encryption.
明确地提到了端到端加密

1364
01:06:22,735 --> 01:06:25,110
It's a feature that's becoming a little more commonplace,
这是一个越来越普遍的功能

1365
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:28,220
but something you should seek out when you don't necessarily trust or want
但是，当你不想信任中间的设备时，你应该寻找这个功能

1366
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:31,610
to trust the machine in the middle, the point
不想信任中间的设备，也就是

1367
01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:36,200
C between A and B. So, indeed, when sending messages on phones
A 和 B 之间的 C。所以，确实，当你用手机发送信息时

1368
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,188
and even video conferencing nowadays too.
甚至现在进行视频会议时也是如此

1369
01:06:38,188 --> 01:06:40,730
And here's something where sometimes you kind of have to dig.
有些时候，你需要深入挖掘

1370
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:43,020
Most of us are familiar with Zoom certainly by now.
我们大多数人现在肯定都熟悉 Zoom 了

1371
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:44,990
And if we go into Zoom settings, which I did
如果你打开 Zoom 的设置，我今天早上也这样做了

1372
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:48,470
this morning to take this screenshot, this is what it looks like as of now.
拍下了这个截图，目前它看起来是这样的

1373
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:51,290
Here's the menu of options for creating a new meeting.
这是创建新会议的选项菜单

1374
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:53,450
And toward the bottom here-- it's a little small--
在底部，字体比较小

1375
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:56,180
you'll notice that you have two options for encryption.
你会注意到你有两种加密选项

1376
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:58,520
And funny, enough the one that's typically selected
有趣的是，默认情况下选择的

1377
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:02,825
by default, unless you opt in to the other one, is enhanced encryption.
选项，除非你选择另一个，是增强加密

1378
01:07:02,825 --> 01:07:03,950
Brilliant marketing, right?
营销策略很厉害，对吧？

1379
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:05,990
Who doesn't want enhanced encryption.
谁不想要增强加密呢？

1380
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:10,067
It is weaker than this encryption though, which is end-to-end encryption.
但是，它比这种加密更弱，这种加密是端到端加密

1381
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:11,900
End-to-end encryption means that when you're
端到端加密意味着，当你

1382
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:14,180
having a video conference with one or more people,
和一个或多个其他人进行视频会议时

1383
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:18,200
not even Zoom can see or hear what you're talking about.
即使是 Zoom 也看不到，也听不到你们在说什么

1384
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,470
Enhanced encryption means no one between you
增强加密意味着，你

1385
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:24,660
and Zoom can hear or see what you're talking about.
与 Zoom 之间没有人能听到或看到你们在说什么

1386
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:28,880
So end-to-end ensures that it's A to B, and if Zoom is C In the story,
所以，端到端加密确保信息从 A 传递到 B，如果 Zoom 是故事中的 C

1387
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,350
even Zoom can't see what you're doing.
即使是 Zoom 也看不到你们在做什么

1388
01:07:31,350 --> 01:07:32,600
Now, there are some downsides.
当然，也有一些缺点

1389
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,460
And there's some little fine print here.
这里有一些细则

1390
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:39,140
When you enable end-to-end encryption on a cloud-based service like Zoom,
当你启用像 Zoom 这样的云服务上的端到端加密时

1391
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:41,220
you can't use cloud recordings anymore.
你不能再使用云录制了。

1392
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:41,720
Why?
为什么？

1393
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,670
Well, if Zoom by definition mathematically
嗯，如果Zoom从定义上来说，在数学上

1394
01:07:43,670 --> 01:07:46,670
can't see or hear your meeting, how are they going to record it for you?
无法看到或听到你的会议，他们怎么能为你录制呢？

1395
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:48,200
It's just random zeros and ones.
它只是随机的0和1。

1396
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,690
You can still record it locally on your Mac or PC,
你仍然可以在你的Mac或PC上本地录制，

1397
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:53,060
but end-to-end encryption ensures that you
但端到端加密确保了你

1398
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:56,600
don't have to worry about prying eyes-- be it a company, be it a government,
不必担心窥视的眼睛——无论是公司、政府，

1399
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,738
a state more generally.
或者更普遍地说，一个国家。

1400
01:07:57,738 --> 01:08:00,530
And so societally, you'll start to see this discussed probably even
因此在社会上，你会看到这可能比现在更频繁地被讨论

1401
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:04,220
more than it already is when it comes to personal liberties and freedom
当涉及到个人自由的时候，比现在还要多。

1402
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:07,700
among citizens of countries and states because
因为这是国家和地区公民的自由。

1403
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:10,583
of the implications for actual privacy that these primitives
因为这些基本原理对实际隐私的影响

1404
01:08:10,583 --> 01:08:13,250
that we've been discussing and that you even explored in week 2,
我们一直在讨论，你甚至在第二周探索了，

1405
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:17,882
albeit weakly, with these ciphers we used in the real world.
尽管很弱，但我们使用了这些我们在现实世界中使用的密码。

1406
01:08:17,882 --> 01:08:20,840
But encryption has one other use that's worth knowing about too and yet
但加密还有另一个值得了解的用途，同时

1407
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,319
another feature to turn on.
还有一个功能可以开启。

1408
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:26,569
So when it comes to deleting files, odds are, most everyone in the room
所以当谈到删除文件时，很有可能，房间里的大多数人

1409
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:31,100
knows on a Mac or PC that when you drag a file to the trashcan or the recycle
都知道在Mac或PC上，当你把文件拖到垃圾桶或回收站时

1410
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:35,090
bin, it doesn't actually go away unless you right click
里，它实际上不会消失，除非你右键点击

1411
01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:38,540
or Control click or go to the appropriate menu and empty the trash.
或Ctrl点击或进入相应的菜单并清空垃圾桶。

1412
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:42,020
But did anyone know that even when you empty the trash or recycle bin,
但有人知道即使你清空了垃圾桶或回收站，

1413
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:44,870
the file also doesn't really go away.
该文件实际上并没有消失。

1414
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,479
Your operating system typically just forgets where it is.
你的操作系统通常只是忘记了它在哪里。

1415
01:08:47,479 --> 01:08:51,140
But the zeros and ones that compose the file or files you tried to delete
但是组成你试图删除的文件的0和1

1416
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:53,600
are still there for the pickings, especially
仍然存在，尤其

1417
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,729
if someone gets physical or virtual access to your system.
如果有人获得了你系统的物理或虚拟访问权限。

1418
01:08:56,729 --> 01:08:59,845
So, for instance, here is a whole bunch of ones and zeros.
例如，这里有一堆0和1。

1419
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:01,970
Maybe it's representing something on my hard drive.
也许它代表着我的硬盘上的某些东西。

1420
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:04,279
And suppose that I want to go ahead and delete
假设我想删除

1421
01:09:04,279 --> 01:09:08,060
a file that comprises these zeros and ones, these bits here.
包含这些0和1的文件，这些位。

1422
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:10,340
Well, when your operating system deletes the file,
那么，当你的操作系统删除文件时，

1423
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:13,040
even if you click on Empty Trash or Empty Recycle Bin,
即使你点击清空垃圾桶或清空回收站，

1424
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:18,319
it essentially just forgets about those bits, but doesn't actually change them.
它本质上只是忘记了这些位，但并没有真正改变它们。

1425
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:21,560
Only once you create a new file or download something else
只有当你创建一个新文件或下载其他东西时

1426
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:25,189
do some of those zeros and ones end up getting overwritten.
这些0和1中的一些才会被覆盖。

1427
01:09:25,189 --> 01:09:29,000
And per the yellow remnants here, the implication of this contrived example
根据这里的黄色残余，这个编造的例子所暗示的是

1428
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,149
is that even at this point in time you can still recover
即使在此时此刻，你仍然可以恢复

1429
01:09:32,149 --> 01:09:34,098
like half of the file, it would seem.
似乎有一半的文件。

1430
01:09:34,098 --> 01:09:36,140
So maybe the juicy part with a credit card number
所以也许是包含信用卡号码的那部分

1431
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:38,890
or a message that you really wanted to delete or the like, there's
或者是你真的想删除的信息，或者类似的东西，还有

1432
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:41,330
still remnants on the computer's hard drive here.
计算机硬盘上的残余。

1433
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:42,720
So what's the alternative?
那么有什么替代方案呢？

1434
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,553
Well, if you really want to be thorough, you
如果你真的想彻底一点，你可以

1435
01:09:44,553 --> 01:09:47,600
could delete files and then download the biggest possible movies you
删除文件，然后下载你能下载的最大的电影

1436
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,580
can to really fill up your hard drive.
来填满你的硬盘。

1437
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:51,925
Because, probabilistically, you would end up
因为，从概率上来说，你最终会

1438
01:09:51,925 --> 01:09:54,050
overwriting all of those zeros and ones eventually.
最终覆盖掉所有的0和1。

1439
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:56,422
But that's not really a tenable solution.
但这并不是一个可行的解决方案。

1440
01:09:56,422 --> 01:09:58,130
It would just take too much time and it's
这将花费太多时间，而且

1441
01:09:58,130 --> 01:10:00,220
fraught with possible simple mistakes.
很容易犯一些简单的错误。

1442
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:02,500
So what should we do instead, well, maybe we
那么我们应该怎么做呢？也许我们

1443
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,720
should securely delete information.
应该安全地删除信息。

1444
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,910
And securely delete would mean when you actually
而安全地删除意味着当你真正地

1445
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:11,290
empty the recycle bin or the trash can, what happens to the original zeros
清空了回收站或垃圾桶，原始的0和1会发生什么

1446
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:14,050
and ones is that you take them and you change all of them
和1，你将它们拿走，把它们都

1447
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:17,900
to zeros or all of them to ones or all of them to random zeros and ones.
变成0，或者全部变成1，或者全部变成随机的0和1。

1448
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:18,400
Why?
为什么？

1449
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,500
So that you can still reuse those bits now,
这样你就可以重新使用这些位了，

1450
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:23,650
but there's no remnants even on the computer's hard drive
但即使在计算机的硬盘上，也没有任何残余

1451
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:25,480
that they were once there.
表明它们曾经存在过。

1452
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:28,720
But even now, this is not fully robust.
但即使现在，这也不是完全健壮的。

1453
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:29,320
Why?
为什么？

1454
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:33,610
It turns out that because of today's electronics and solid state devices,
事实证明，由于当今的电子产品和固态设备，

1455
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:38,132
there might still be remnants of files on them because these hard drives,
它们上面可能仍然存在文件残余，因为这些硬盘，

1456
01:10:38,132 --> 01:10:40,090
these storage devices nowadays are smart enough
现在的存储设备足够智能

1457
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:42,460
that if they realize that parts of them are failing,
如果它们意识到它们的部分正在失效，

1458
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:45,550
they might prevent you from changing data in certain corners.
它们可能会阻止你在某些角落修改数据。

1459
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:48,550
So if you think of your memory as like a big rectangle, some of the bits
所以如果你把你的内存想象成一个大矩形，一些位

1460
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:51,855
might get blocked off to you just over time.
可能会随着时间的推移而被屏蔽掉。

1461
01:10:51,855 --> 01:10:53,480
So there might still be remnants there.
所以可能仍然存在残余。

1462
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:57,670
So if you really are worried about a sibling, an employer, or a government
所以如果你真的担心你的兄弟姐妹、雇主或政府

1463
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:01,130
like finding data on that system, there might actually still be remnants.
能够在该系统上找到数据，实际上可能仍然存在残余。

1464
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:03,050
Now, you can go extreme and just physically
现在，你可以采取极端措施，直接物理地

1465
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:05,258
destroy the device, which should be pretty effective.
销毁设备，这应该非常有效。

1466
01:11:05,258 --> 01:11:08,600
But that's going to get pretty expensive over time when you want to delete data.
但当你想要删除数据时，随着时间的推移，这会变得非常昂贵。

1467
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:13,140
Or, again, we can use encryption as the solution to this problem.
或者，我们再次可以使用加密作为这个问题的解决方案。

1468
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:15,500
So, again, encryption is increasingly in the real world
所以，再次强调，加密在现实世界中越来越

1469
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:19,650
an amazing tool for your toolkit because it can be deployed in different ways.
成为你工具箱中的一款神奇工具，因为它可以以不同的方式部署。

1470
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:22,280
So, in this case, full disk encryption is something
所以，在这种情况下，全盘加密是一个

1471
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,500
you can enable in Windows or Mac OS.
你可以在Windows或Mac OS中启用。

1472
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:27,050
Nowadays, it's typically enabled by default on iOS
如今，它通常在iOS上默认启用

1473
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:29,540
and you can opt in as well on other platforms.
你也可以在其他平台上选择加入。

1474
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:33,500
In the world of full disk encryption, instead of storing any of your files
在全盘加密的世界里，你不再将你的任何文件存储为

1475
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:37,640
as a plain text, like in their original raw format,
纯文本，就像它们原始的格式一样，

1476
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:41,390
you essentially randomize everything on the disk instead.
你本质上是将磁盘上的所有内容随机化。

1477
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:45,110
You rely on the user's password or some unique string
你依赖于用户密码或他们知道的某些唯一字符串

1478
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:47,150
that they know when you log into your Mac or PC
当你登录你的Mac或PC时。

1479
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:49,958
to essentially scramble the entire contents of the hard drive.
来对硬盘的整个内容进行加密。

1480
01:11:49,958 --> 01:11:51,500
And it's not quite as simple as that.
而且情况并不像看起来那么简单。

1481
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,300
Typically, there's a much larger key that's
通常，有一个更大的密钥

1482
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:56,570
used that in turn is protected by your actual password.
被使用，而它又受到你实际密码的保护。

1483
01:11:56,570 --> 01:12:01,310
But, in this case, this means that if someone steals your laptop while you're
但，在这种情况下，这意味着如果有人在你

1484
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:04,520
not paying attention in Starbucks or the airport or even your dorm room,
没有注意的情况下，在星巴克或机场，甚至在你的宿舍里，

1485
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,010
even if they open the lid and don't have your password,
即使他们打开盖子，没有你的密码，

1486
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:09,260
they're not going to be able to access any of the data
他们将无法访问任何数据

1487
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:11,120
because it's just going to look like zeros and ones.
因为它看起来就像零和一。

1488
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,287
Even if they remove the hard drive from your device,
即使他们从你的设备上拆下硬盘，

1489
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:16,790
plug it into another device, they're only going to see zeros and ones.
把它插到另一个设备上，他们也只能看到零和一。

1490
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:21,170
Now, if you walk away from your laptop at Starbucks with the lid open
现在，如果你在星巴克把笔记本电脑的盖子打开就离开了

1491
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:24,290
and you're logged in, there is a window of opportunity.
并且你已经登录，就会有一段可乘之机。

1492
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:27,500
Because the data has got to be decrypted when you care about it and when
因为当你在乎数据的时候，当你使用数据的时候，它必须被解密。

1493
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:28,500
you're using it.
你在使用它。

1494
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:31,178
So here too is another example of best practice.
所以这里也是另一个最佳实践的例子。

1495
01:12:31,178 --> 01:12:33,470
You should minimally be closing the lid of your laptop,
你至少应该把笔记本电脑的盖子关上，

1496
01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:36,530
making sure it's logging you out or at least locking the screen,
确保它把你注销，或者至少锁住屏幕，

1497
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:39,050
so that someone can't just walk off with your device
这样别人就无法拿着你的设备走掉

1498
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:42,350
and have access to your logged in account.
并且访问你的已登录账户。

1499
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:45,500
But full disk encryption essentially decreases the probability
但全盘加密本质上降低了

1500
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,417
that an adversary is going to be successful.
攻击者成功的可能性。

1501
01:12:47,417 --> 01:12:49,250
In the world of Macs, it's called FileVault.
在 Mac 世界中，它被称为 FileVault。

1502
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:50,330
It's in your System Preferences.

1503
01:12:50,330 --> 01:12:51,470
Windows, it's called BitLocker.
Windows 中，它被称为 BitLocker。

1504
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:52,910
There's third party solutions too.
也有第三方解决方案。

1505
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:55,340
Here too, we have to trust that Microsoft and Apple don't
在这里，我们也要相信微软和苹果不会

1506
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:57,290
screw up and write buggy code.
出错并写出有错误的代码。

1507
01:12:57,290 --> 01:13:00,590
But generally speaking, turning on features like these things
但总的来说，开启像这些功能

1508
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:02,150
are good for you.
对你来说是有好处的。

1509
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:08,000
Except what's maybe an obvious downside of doing this?
除了可能的一个明显的缺点？

1510
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,705
What's that?
是什么？

1511
01:13:08,705 --> 01:13:09,580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
观众： [听不见]

1512
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:11,140
DAVID MALAN: Yeah, if you forget your password.
大卫·马兰：是的，如果你忘记了密码。

1513
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:12,970
There's no mathematician in the world who

1514
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:15,590
is probably going to be able to recover your data for you.
可能能够帮你恢复数据。

1515
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:17,800
So there too, it's maybe a hefty tradeoff.
所以，这也是一个相当大的权衡。

1516
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,930
But hopefully you have enough defenses in place,
但希望你有足够的防御措施，

1517
01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:22,360
be it your-- a good password, a password manager,

1518
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:25,610
maybe even printing out your primary password on a sheet of paper,
也许甚至把你的主要密码打印在一张纸上，

1519
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:28,810
but locking it in a box or bringing it home so that no one near you
但把它锁在一个盒子里，或者带回家，这样你身边的人

1520
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:32,618
actually has physical access, you can at least mitigate some of these risks.
实际上无法接触到它，你至少可以减轻一些这些风险。

1521
01:13:32,618 --> 01:13:34,910
You'll read about, though, in the real world even this,
不过，你会在现实世界中读到，即使是这个，

1522
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:37,510
which is like an adversarial use of full disk encryption.
这就像对全盘加密的对抗性使用。

1523
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:39,455
Sometimes when hackers get into systems, this
有时当黑客进入系统时，这

1524
01:13:39,455 --> 01:13:42,580
has happened literally with hospital systems, municipal government systems,
已经发生在医院系统、市政政府系统，

1525
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:43,210
and the like.
等等。

1526
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:47,900
If they hack into them, they don't just delete the data or just create havoc,
如果他们入侵了它们，他们不仅会删除数据，或者制造混乱，

1527
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:51,190
they will proactively encrypt the server's hard drive
他们会主动地用一个只有黑客知道的随机密钥加密服务器的硬盘

1528
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:53,685
with some random key that only the hacker knows.
用一个只有黑客知道的随机密钥加密服务器的硬盘。

1529
01:13:53,685 --> 01:13:55,810
They will then demand that the hospital or the town
然后他们会要求医院或城镇

1530
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:58,150
pay them, often in Bitcoin or some cryptocurrency
付钱给他们，通常是比特币或其他加密货币

1531
01:13:58,150 --> 01:14:00,700
to decrease the probability of being caught,
以降低被抓到的可能性，

1532
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:05,860
and they'll only turn over that key to decrypt the data if someone actually
而且他们只有在有人实际

1533
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:06,530
pays up.
付钱的时候才会交出那个密钥来解密数据。

1534
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:09,990
So here too, there's sort of a dark side of these mathematical principles.
所以，这些数学原理也有一面黑暗的一面。

1535
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:15,020
So there too, it's always a trade off between good people and perhaps bad.
所以，这也永远是好人与坏人之间的权衡。

1536
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:17,390
Well, maybe before we wrap and before we serve
好吧，在我们结束之前，在我们提供之前

1537
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:20,180
some cake in the transept, Carter, can you join me one last time?
一些蛋糕在耳堂里，卡特，你能最后一次加入我吗？

1538
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:23,750
But, first, before I turn things over to me and Carter, here's your problem
但是，首先，在我把事情交给我和卡特之前，这是你的问题

1539
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:26,270
set 10, a sort of unofficial homework.
集 10，一个非正式的家庭作业。

1540
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:28,610
One, among your takeaways for today, you should
一、你今天应该记住的一点是，你应该

1541
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:32,815
start using a password manager or even these fancier passkeys, at least
开始使用密码管理器，甚至这些更高级的通行证，至少

1542
01:14:32,815 --> 01:14:34,190
for your most sensitive accounts.
用于你最敏感的账户。

1543
01:14:34,190 --> 01:14:37,220
So anything medical, financial, particularly personal,

1544
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:40,193
like this is a very concrete takeaway and action item.
就像这是一个非常具体的收获和行动项目。

1545
01:14:40,193 --> 01:14:42,860
I wouldn't sit down and try to change all of your accounts over.
我不会坐下来尝试更改你所有的账户。

1546
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:45,440
Because knowing humans, You're not going to get through the whole to-do list.
因为了解人类，你不会完成整个待办事项列表。

1547
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,170
So maybe do it the next time you log into that account,
所以，也许下次你登录那个账户的时候，

1548
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:50,890
turn on some of these features or add it to a password manager
打开一些这些功能，或者添加到密码管理器中

1549
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:52,640
or at least start with the most important.

1550
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,860
Two, turning on two-factor authentication

1551
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:57,390
beyond where you have to at places like Harvard and Yale,
超出你在哈佛和耶鲁等地方必须做的事情，

1552
01:14:57,390 --> 01:15:00,740
but certainly bank accounts, privates, anything medical, personal,
但当然，银行账户、私人信息、任何医疗、个人方面的信息，

1553
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:01,290
or the like.
等等。

1554
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:04,670
And then lastly, where you can, turning on end-to-end encryption.
最后，在你可以的地方，开启端到端加密。

1555
01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:07,020
Being careful with it, you don't want to go
小心点，你不想

1556
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:10,545
and during lecture, hopefully no one clicked the turn on FileVault button
在讲座期间，希望没有人点击了开启 FileVault 按钮

1557
01:15:10,545 --> 01:15:11,420
while we're in class.
在我们上课的时候。

1558
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:14,300
Because closing your laptop lid while things are being encrypted
因为在加密的时候关闭笔记本电脑的盖子

1559
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:16,250
is generally bad practice.
通常是不好的做法。

1560
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:18,870
See us after though if you did do that a moment ago.
不过，如果你刚才做到了，请事后来找我们。

1561
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:21,140
So here's just then three actionable takeaways.
所以，这里就是三个可以操作的收获。

1562
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:24,860
But we thought we'd conclude by taking a few final minutes for a CS50 quiz
但我们想用最后几分钟来做 CS50 的小测验

1563
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:28,700
show of sorts, a final check for understanding using some questions

1564
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:31,580
we come up with ourselves, but also some of the review questions

1565
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:34,830
that you all kindly contributed as part of the most recent problem set.
你们大家作为最近一次作业的一部分，很乐意贡献。

1566
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:37,580
So some of these questions come from you yourselves.
所以，这些问题中有一些来自你们自己。

1567
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:41,690
And let me go ahead and turn things over to Carter here to help run the show.
让我把事情交给卡特，让他来主持节目。

1568
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:46,190
We will invite you at this point to take out that same device

01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:23,450
All right, next question, what does I++ do in C++ where I is an integer value?
好的，下一题，在 C++ 中 I++ 的作用是什么，其中 I 是一个整数值？

1722
01:22:23,450 --> 01:22:26,290
Note, for the record, we did not teach C++ in this course,
注意，为了记录，我们在这门课程中没有教授 C++，

1723
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:29,980
but this question is from you.
但这个问题是你们提出来的。

1724
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:34,600
I will admit it's the same as in C, which we did teach.
我承认它和 C 语言中的作用一样，我们确实教授过 C 语言。

1725
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,840
Decrements the integer, deletes the integer, increments the integer by one,
减少整数值、删除整数值、将整数值增加 1、

1726
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,030
or reassigns the integer to zero?
还是将整数值重新设置为零？

1727
01:22:40,030 --> 01:22:42,580
The most popular answer and correct answer
最受欢迎的答案也是正确的答案

1728
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:45,490
is increments the integer by one.
是将整数值增加 1。

1729
01:22:45,490 --> 01:22:47,500
It definitely doesn't decrement, so.
它肯定不会减小，所以。

1730
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,990
All right, two responses still atop the list.
好的，两个答案仍然在榜首。

1731
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:52,900
And here we have 6,000-plus, 6,000, and 6,000.
这里有超过 6,000 分、6,000 分和 6,000 分。

1732
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:53,980
So it's getting closer.
所以越来越接近了。

1733
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:56,890
Using a hash table to retrieve data is useful
使用哈希表检索数据很有用

1734
01:22:56,890 --> 01:23:03,490
because it theoretically achieves a search time of O of n, O of n log n,
因为它理论上可以实现 O(n) 的搜索时间、O(n log n) 的搜索时间、

1735
01:23:03,490 --> 01:23:06,250
O of log n, or O of 1?
O(log n) 的搜索时间还是 O(1) 的搜索时间？

1736
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:10,950
Five seconds to make your decision.
还有 5 秒钟做出你的决定。

1737

Getting a little harder.
越来越难了。

1738
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:16,920
And let's see the results.
让我们看看结果。

01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:24,630
O of 1, only 30% of you got the correct answer from a very core week 5 topic.
只有 30% 的人答对了这道非常重要的第五周的题目，正确答案是 O(1)。

1740
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:27,360
That is the theoretical hope of a hash table.
那是哈希表的理论期望。

1741
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:33,090
In practice, though, to be fair, it can devolve, as we saw, into O of n.
然而，公平地说，在实际应用中，它可能会退化成 O(n)，就像我们之前看到的那样。

1742
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:36,850
We didn't really see those other two answers in the context of hash tables
我们并没有真正看到其他两个答案在哈希表的语境中
